Player: Sarah / Juno (she/her)

## About

- Killed by a married couple after flirting with them

## First Impressions

- Dad bard
- A rather small, lively, dwarf, very pale, "cersei lannister" long hair, green eyes
- As you get closer to him you notice a sweet nectar scent in the air (10 ft radius of him). Makes one think of sunshine and a bright summer day

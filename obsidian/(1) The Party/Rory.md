## Vows

> [!quote] Rory's Oath
[[Rory]] gets knighted by her dad, [[Ser George]]. [[Rory's Oathblade]] allows [[Ser George|George]] to wield it, and as he holds it the sword slowly changes shape. He speaks [[Rory]]'s vow:
> 
> - By the [[Drasil|Green Knight]]: I charge you to be just and vigilant, honoring the will of this world.
> - By the [[Myrmidia|Lady of Steel]]: I charge you to not blindly rush in or act without provocation.
> - By the [[Edris|Hand Who Helps]]: I charge you to protect those who cannot protect themselves.
> - By the [[(2) Campaign/(1) Entities/Hair of Fire|Hair of Fire]] ([[Ser George|George]]'s voice warps to sound like the [[Lady of Teeth]]): I charge you to open the ways of the old magic and to protect the seals which bind the [[False Queen]].
> - Speaking with every voice who has once wielded [[Rory's Oathblade]]: We knight you to the [Lineage of the Kings Guard], as the bearer of [[Rory's Oathblade|Sentinel]]... [[Rory|Ser Aurora, the Fiery Mane]]... To be bound to this duty in life and in death. So sayeth we, all who have held this blade before.

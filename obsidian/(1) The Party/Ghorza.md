## Vows

> [!quote] Ghorza's Oath
> [[Ghorza]] awakens to the tang of iron, mud, and steel. She finds herself on the top of a grassy hill, surveying out she sees thousands upon thousands of weapons, many of which are bloody and bent. She is circled by a barrier of blades, placed around her like a fence post with [[Myrmidia]] in the center. She addresses [[Ghorza]]:
> - Every step of your journey you have met friends, companions... Three of your traveling companions have been tasked with protecting the mortal realm from the [[False Queen]]. You would honor me if you would join them. And you would honor me if you would do so in my name. [[Ghorza|Ghorza Morn]], by your name, by your oath...
> - Do you swear: To protect the realm from the [[False Queen]]'s invasion. 
> - Do you swear: To guard the realm of men, woman, and children from all who would seek it harm? Kneel.
> - "I swear." Her axe engraves itself with a symbol of [[Myrmidia]].
> - Take up your axe. Arise [[Ghorza|Ser Ghorza Morn, Daughter of the Bloode]]... Daughter by blood, chosen by choice.

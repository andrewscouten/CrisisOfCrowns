## From Session

> [!summary]+ [[Session 3]]
> - No longer in a tavern; shadow/misty [grove], crash of waves off in the distance
> - The mist and leaves don't shake or move, frozen
> - Around him, he sees sign of death and violence; weapons, armor, bodies, some fresh some long rotten.
> - In front of him, [a broken statue]
> - This statue is a shrine that has fallen into disrepair long ago in front of him.
> 	- He feels regret, sadness, and grief
> - He feels the wind around him push him forward (15-20ft). He trips over a Morningstar embedded in the chest of a skeleton
> - He looks back, the shrine is repaired
> 	- Pieces of rock create an arm, and he hears "Cheer up, the worst is yet to come"
> - He awakens

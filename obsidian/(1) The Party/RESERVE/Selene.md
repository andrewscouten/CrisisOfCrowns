## First Impressions

- 5ft tall, white luminous curls in hair
- Worn but well dressed, almost makeshift armor
- Glowing green eyes that seem almost “other”
- Twinkling freckles that almost appear to be constellations
- Striding with a purpose

## From Session

> [!summary]+ [[Session 3]]
> - [[Selene]] falls into a slumber
> - She blinks her eyes and she's standing in a field of flowers
> 	- It's very pretty, but you can tell this was once a battlefield
> 	- There's a structure off in the distance, it's hazy as if in a mirage
> - She carefully makes her way towards the structure
> 	- It's almost as if she can walk through the ex-battlefield, unbothered
> 	- As she starts to near the structure-- now looking like her [[Selene's Temple]], she hears a voice
> 		- "Not yet my child, you are not ready. Your persistence will bloom"
> 		- Memories of training and skills, but not her memories. Sees what could have been

## From Session

> [!summary]+ [[Session 3]]
> - [[Fyudor]] falls into an exhaustive sleep; awakens in his room
> - The room is empty, he feels the feeling of [his skin getting scratched but from the inside of the ribcage]. Something is inside of him, trying to claw its way out.
> - Hears growling, cold breath, before everything returning to normal
> - His hands have his blood on them, from clutching his palms in his sleep

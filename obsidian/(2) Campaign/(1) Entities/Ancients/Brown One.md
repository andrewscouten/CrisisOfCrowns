## About

- Large owl-bear with a curse
- She is a daughter of the mother of bears [[Ur-Mother Bear]]
	- Born between the mother and father
	- The two of them shaped her out of nothing
- Guardian of the [[Temple of Drasil]]

### [[Temple of Drasil]]

- Her and her siblings were tasked with guarding sacred locations; in return her mother's people would be left to thrive
- She has guarded the temple every day, for a very very long time

### Affliction / Curse
- Took a rest and woke up one day and had branches growing out of her spine
- Initial Description
	- As the bear approaches, we see it is covered in wounds, branches & thorns. Some of the branches are coming back out of it and growing back into it
- The thing growing in her is hunting for energy. It reacts to radiant energy with growing into whatever it can get its branches into
- Someone in the past had tried to remove this curse with no change
- [Detect magic] reveals that it is similar to an occultist spell, but not one that [[Blume]] recognizes
	- Mix of necromancy and transmutation
	- She gives off an ancient magic
		- [[Blume]] knows of the [[Singers of Sea and Sky]]. They have oral tales have been passed down over a thousand years. That magic is old, hers is older.
	- Some of the brambles are surface level, some are deep inside of her
- [Detect Good and Evil] reveals that this:
	- Counts as celestial and undead magic
	- Counts as desecrated
- [Few can wield such curses]
	- [[Lord of Blood]]
	- [[The Stranger]]
	- [[Ealena]]
	- Some Archfey
		- [[The King of Nothing]]

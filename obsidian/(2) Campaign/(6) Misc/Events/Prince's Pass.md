- The name for the general event caused by the full death of [[Stag Lord|Ser Leona Blackmont]] and her manifold skulls and alters
- After the death, many many people died of apparent strokes, all on the same night. This included some religious priests across the continent, many nobles (usually a second or third child), and even the [[Boy-King]].
- As he had no heirs of his own, the throne's line of succession is in disarray, and a civil war has erupted from a small handful of the Boy-King's father's other bastards and siblings. [[King Garette Norcross]] was a notorious philanderer and adulterer, having no less than [16 acknowledged bastards], plus likely more unknown to him. Add in some other family and whatnot, and you've got a recipe for a massive civil war for the throne.

## About

- Long before [[King Garette Norcross|Garette Norcross]] was High King of [[Ethemore|Ethemore]], he was merely the 3rd child of his father, [[King Jarekk Norcross]] of The [[Grass Sea|Great Grass Sea]], and as such, being the Spare's Spare, thought he could marry for love. And he did. 
- Marrying a lowborn girl in the year 462, he thought all would be well. Then his father annulled the marriage at the turn of the 463rd year, sent the girl packing, and promptly forced [[King Garette Norcross|Garette]] to marry his second and last wife, and eventual Queen, [[High Lady Henrietta Reventree]]. 
- But this young lowborn former wife of his was pregnant when the marriage was annulled, and as such, when her daughter was born, the now [[King Garette Norcross|King Garette]] (not High King yet), acknowledged the girl, not as a bastard, but simply a daughter in another family, one without his name, with [[King Garette Norcross|Garette]] making sure she received a decent education, some gifts, and a small plot of land as a Clanly ranked woman. 
- Upon his death, and the subsequent death of his only Legitimate child, [[King Garette Norcross|Garette]]'s youngest and final sibling, [[Prince Beorneth Norcross]] has raised her to the Queenship, claiming that, while not of his name, the now eneoffed [[Queen Janeth Norcross]] is the only of his remaining children to be born of a marriage at all, rather than being a true bastard. And thus, while not the eldest child, she is the rightful heir to the throne. Her claim is supported by the [[Bitter Water Vale|Vale]] (mostly), the majority of the [[Bitter Water Vale]] Houses, and the Clawfolk of Crackclaw Point and the [[Bay of Crabs]]

### Goal

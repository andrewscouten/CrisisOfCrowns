## About

- Made up of many noble houses from the [[Three Sisters]].
- They seek recompense and revenge for their unlawfully detained and executed [High Lord] and some of his family and principle banner-folk, captured and later killed by the [[Boy-King]]'s orders. 
- While they don't support any of the [[Norcrossian]] groups directly, they do seem to have a current ceasefire with the group who call themselves The Followers/Fellowship of the Rightful Queen. 
- At the start of season 2, they have been raiding into the [[Bitter Water Vale|Vale]], the coastal towns of the [[Bitter Water]], and even into the [[Southern Reaches]], as those three regions support other contenders to the throne.

### Goal
Recompense for the lives unjustly taken and the nobles who are unjustly still imprisoned in the [[Crowned Keep]].

### Located
Operated out of the [[Village of the Three Wolves]]

## Council Heads

- [[Lady Barra Wolfswoode]]

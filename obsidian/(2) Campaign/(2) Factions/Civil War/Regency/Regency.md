The next faction, found within the Crowned Keep itself and centered in The Great Grass Sea, and parts of the Bitterwater and Deadlands, is the claim supported by Lord Protector and Lady Regent of the Realm Harpar Botchart. She has raised one of Garette's youngest Bastards to the throne, mainly for the reason of his noble blood and upraising. His mother, High Lady Wrend of House Gogorias Valdor was the last remaining blood relative to that cursed House, having been eradicated by King Garette himself during the Hellgate Rebellion, also called The Slaver's Rebellion of 474. Begetting High Lady Wrend with child before having her killed, the young Narrek Norcross, ne Waters, was to be raised and legitimized to rule that region by his father. Of course, Daddy Dearest died before that happened, and as such, the young bastard boy was legimized by Lady Harpar as the only son or daughter of Garrette to have the blood worthy of kingship, and the education for it, having been raised in the royal court.

Also claiming the crown for himself is the Conquering King's eldest acknowledged bastard, and also eldest acknowledged child, [[Moreth Stone]]. Raised in a Baronic court of the [[Southern Reaches]] by his mother's family, [[Moreth Stone|Moreth]] was acknowledged by the king as family, but never directly supported by him, aside from a few birthing day gifts and the occasional letter. Yet, as the eldest remaining child, illegitimate or not, he claims (with support from many lower nobles and clans of the Reaches, the Southern Valleys of the Sisters, and the southern-most regions of the [[Bitter Water Vale|Vale]]), that his claim to the throne is rightful, for children come before siblings, even if those children are illegitimate. A known hunter and Folk Hero, Moreth has claimed the title of King of the Mountains and Tundras, Rightful Heir to the High Throne of Ethemore, Protector of the Old Faith, and Master of the Gap. Notably, he has not legitimized himself, still being King Moreth Stone, rather than King Moreth Norcross. At the moment, really no one knows why.

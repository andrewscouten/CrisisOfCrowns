# Ritual to See Without Eyes

> [!info] [[Blume]] conducts this ritual with [[Drakhook]]. 

## Intent

[[Blume]] is wanting to see through the eyes of the [[Wyrd Tree]], the one that has seen over the construction and history of the [[Capital City]], specifically the [[Crowned Keep]].

[[Drakhook]] agrees to join... Knowing that [[Blume]] knows the name of [[Brown One|Rkto]]. He has his own sights to see.

## Praxis  

They bond their blood before the ritual, [[Drakhook]] ripping out his eye and smearing it on the [[Wyrd Tree]]'s bark. 

They both reach throughout time, a time before the [[Crowned Keep]].
- Sigil of the settlers of the hill, back when it was just a small building, checkered green and silver with an axe.
- [[Norcrossian]] family established the city 350 years ago, they were not kings.
- For all their importance, the [[Norcrossian]] family is belligerent with their own family and banner-men. As time passes he sees groups of armed forces camping outside (sieges), servant revolts, marriage ceremonies, coronations, and executions all within the [[God's Woods]].
- A large orcish man wearing a crown is often seen in the [[God's Woods]], presumably [[King Garette Norcross]]
- A brunette woman in their 30s/40s leaves and comes into the [[God's Woods]] often... A specific time she brings in the [[Crown's Guard]] and they hand an effigy in the tree... Her face cannot be made out, but a smile appears that is far too wide and far too sharp...

## Consequence

[[Blume]]
- Once inside the [[Crowned Keep]]'s walls, [[Blume]] knows some unknown interior corridors... Has advantage on finding them.
- Deaf in his right ear, disadvantage on hearing based perception... disadvantage on insights requiring hearing... Resistant to thunder damage
- The roots from eyes go into the face, disadvantage to all persuasions chance while the left side of your face is visible, advantage on intimidation
- Right eye has cataracts, cannot see out of it, oracle sight?

[[Drakhook]]
- In a coma, but taken to the temple of [[Edris]]. He will survive and awaken in a few days.

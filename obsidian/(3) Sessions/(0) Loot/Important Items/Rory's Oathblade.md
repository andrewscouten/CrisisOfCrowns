> That is a very old sword for a very young wielder. I do not know its name, but that is an [[Oathblade]] my dear. Many years ago, centuries, swords like these were given to warriors bound by oaths that reached into death. These blades were passed down from knight to squire but were eventually lost to time. I have not heard of them in many many years. The only one I am aware of that's still around is [[The Old Sword of the House of Ash]].

- We haul the owl-bear into town, using the meat from the hunt to throw a feast. It's as happy as anyone has been for awhile, at least since the raid. There are games, drinks, and free food... Everyone passes out happy
- A rider from the [[Boy King]] arrives in town in the morning, they go to [[Baronet, Lady Salrus]].
	- [[Finnegean]] eavesdrops: The [[House Salrus]]'s will not follow the [[Boy King]], it will continue to follow House [[House Reventree]]... They will not listen to the puppet of the boy king
	- You can tell the lord protector exactly what my sister has said... The only thing that will come from it is your death
- [[Baronet, Lady Salrus]] and the house are going to [[Boar Head's Keep]], then to [[Lockshire]], home of [[House Reventree]]
- Our company can now expand. We may now each recruit 9 people, including [[Krusa]].. [[Con'Niall]] convinced us to have 100 total (including us). The last 30 are guards at most
- Previously, these houses were kings. Now they are high-lords:
	- The king in green, Trent
	- [[House Reventree]] were kings
	- House gregourious volder, now extinct
	- House feld'wvel aer'qusv'n
	- House grand anvil
	- Broom-hilm
- The lord protector is not regent, chosen over the boy king's own mother

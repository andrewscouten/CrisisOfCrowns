- Andrew was also absent on a work trip
- Notes from in person recap:
	- Shop called bound by design / desire? Magic tattoo shop, few people go tattoos
	- The people not normally known in the [[Nameless Company]] did the jail break with some good deception rolls, while others stayed behind in the town

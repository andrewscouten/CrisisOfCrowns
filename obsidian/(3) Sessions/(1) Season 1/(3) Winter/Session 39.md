- Visions:
    - [[Blume]]
        - Acid smells from the former fight are replaced with the smells of a forest, compost, rotten trees, growth, etc. Opening his eyes, he finds himself in a forest
        - Following a deer path to a clearing on a hill. Sitting on it is the single largest tree [[Blume]] has ever seen
        - Multitude of faces, each with different emotions
            - "The chosen child seeks us out... Well, well... Lord Blume, brought before us to face the [[False Queen]]. You have suffered much in your young age and will continue, your troubles are not over... But know this..."
                - Every plant shivers and turns towards him, some growing more faces, all with open and shining eyes
            - "Know that we chose you for a reason... Too many voices were silent and too many will continue to be silenced... There are very few who practice the old ways and fewer who will survive what is coming.. Fewer still who will listen when called..."
                - Blume is called towards towards the tree, to a cave going under the tree
                - Inside there is a throne made out of tree roots, many bigger than actual tree trunks
                - The throne shrinks down to Blume size, he sits down in it and feels agony as his eye and leg is ripped off... The roots shiver and writhe as roots wrap around his leg and head..
            - "You are the chosen, of we who simply are... We who are ever-vigilant, we the many faces of knowledge, of the eldest of the eldest, the endless, do you accept this title?" He does. The roots of the chair grow into his leg with searing agony as a tendril of roots grows out from his leg too... The roots are shaping into a branch that has grown out of his leg. It looks like a peg-leg. These roots also dig into his eye as he blinks away blood. He sees himself for a split second. He blinks again, his old eye eaten and his new eye is moving white threads. On the left half of his face is horns of tree roots growing out of his forehead.
                - Rise, [[Lord Blume, of the Eldest of Eldest, Champion of the Endless, Agent of the Green Coven]]
                - Blinking again, he sees an emblem being stitched by the roots into his clothing
                    - An empty face, half smiling, half angry, a symbol of one of the [[Green Coven]]
    - [[Con'Niall|Niall]]
        - As he dozes off, the smell of the bog and party talking fades. Opening his eyes again in an icy cave that has paintings and carvings of history that once was (peace, war, death, etc.).
        - In front of him is a small pathway he slowly makes his way down. At the end of this path is a large cavern, in the middle of it is a giant orc on a throne and sitting next to him is an absolutely massive green dragon curling around the throne. The orc is [[Agrius]], some being thousands of years old, each tale representing a different form of what he sees.
            - [[Greenbelt]] settles as a dragon with antlers and whiskers
            - Around the room sits 3 empty thrones. He realizes this is the same cavern as his last vision
        - Dialogue
            - [[Agrius]]: "You've done well... We've only had to give you a heart attack 3 times. The bar was on the ground and you managed not to trip. Good job."
            - [[Greenbelt]] and take up its place as guardian. This is what you traded for me saving your people. Your days of adventuring are numbered. You have one more task that you chose, and then you are mine until you die. And even then..."
            - [[Agrius]]. Do you accept?"
            - [[Niall]]: "I do."
            - [[Greenbelt]]
        - [[Greenbelt]] laughs as [[Con'Niall|Niall]] blinks, dragon scales growing up his leg eventually covering his cheek and his combat damaged eye & ear. The scales fade and he can see out of both eyes again... His jaw is now half almost-draconic, his other damaged features becoming dragon-like. His damaged hand is now a scaled claw...
            - [[Con'Niall|Niall]] gains a breath weapon, 15 ft cone, replaces an attack (not attack action, but an attack), damage is number of d6 equal to level, choose between psychic, poison, or thunder damage when used, once per short rest or by extending a hit die
        - [[Agrius]]
    - [[Ghorza]]
        - Smells of acid from the last fight slowly fade as she falls asleep. They are replaced by the tang of iron, mud, and steel. She finds herself on the top of a grassy hill, surveying out she sees thousands and thousands of weapons-- many of which are bloody and bent. She is circled by a barrier of blades, placed around her like a fence post.
            - She sees in front of her a roughly human woman in full plate mail, tear drop shaped shield, red cape and sash. Uncanny valley levels of near perfect looking except a terrifying large scar diagonally across her whole face. She is resting on her sword, staring out across the battle below. There are various campus here, similar to [[Ghorza]]'s last vision
            - [[Ghorza]]
        - Dialogue
            - [[Myrmidia]], "Wouldn't you say you had fun?"
            - [[Ghorza]]
            - [[Myrmidia]]: "Good. War is not fun. But you have fought for the right reasons. To protect, honor.. And now I ask, will you fight to serve?"
            - [[Ghorza]]: "Yes"
                - Two tall orcish men appear next to her, one wearing armor and one wearing a wolf pelt. The two of them shifting as [[Myrmidia]],
            - [[Myrmidia]]. You would honor me if you would join them. And you would honor me if you would do so in my name."
            - [[Myrmidia]]'s invasion. Do you swear to guard the realm of men, woman, and children from all who would seek it harm? ... Kneel."
            - [[Ghorza]]: "I swear."
            - [[Myrmidia]], Daughter by blood, chosen by choice"
        - [[Ghorza]]'s clan.
        - Among all of these visages of people that appeared is a relatively small bear that approaches her. "Well met [[Ser Ghorza]]'s head.
            - [[Ghorza]]
        - Gains
            - [[Ghorza]] increases her CHA to 13 and can multi-class into paladin
            - One time, she may cast a 3rd level bless without concentration
    - [[Cassia]]
        - Acid fight smells replaced by the smells of her home as she opens her eyes.
        - She sees three figures standing in front of her: Antlered figure: [[Drasil]]
        - Dialogue
            - [[Drasil]]: "You're a long way from home, aren't you [[Cassia]]?", he says almost jokingly with a shit eating grin. "You've come a long way, but not as far as you'd like have you?" He walks forward, shrinking down to just below [[Cassia]]'s height. "You may not have done as much as you wanted, but you have done enough... But I would ask you do more. Not because you have not done enough, but I know that you can do more. The wheat shall continue to grow and be threshed as it has been done since mortality began... But I would see your stalk go uncut for longer"
            - [[Drasil]]
                - Replaces the last line with: When you cast a leveled spell that damages a target that has no soul, increase the damage die by one. Soul-less creatures are most constructs, most undead, and a number of aberrations
            - [[Drasil]] vanishes
            - [[Posaunia]] shift into a stag with a vulture on it. The stag snorts, and [[Cassia]] hears the world speaking. "We are the gods of death, life, and the cycle itself. Do not fail to uphold that cycle."
        - [[[Cassia]] blinks, environment changing into a glowing yellow field of wheat in every direction flowing by an unfelt wind. She feels a brief peace before the vision ends. She recognizes this as the [Field of Wheat]].
        - Her left eye is now gold, her hair also gaining a golden supernatural tinge. Also eligible for a multi-class in death-cleric. Honorary member of the [[Stalwart Wardens]]
    - [[Rory]]
        - Curling up wrapped around sword, blinking before awakening to a familiar smell of sea spray. They are sitting on the edge of a pier, staring out into the [[Bay of Crabs]] in the village she was raised in. They blink, buildings smoking, bodies littering the ground.. They blink again, back on the bench... It's normal? Again. Looking out, dozen of ships on fire, screams of men. Again... Just a bay, sitting on a bench
        - She sees a kind of ugly woman with bright red hair, relatively long hooked nose, green-ish skin (think witch), in one hand is a sword length item wrapped in cloth, in her other hand is her sharpened nails and a human heart with blood dripping down. She throws the heart into the water and [[[Rory]] sees the violent scene briefly once again. Another woman walks closer into view, the [Lady of Teeth]].
        - Walking out of the bay is hundreds of half incorporeal figures walking out of the water. For a split second, [[[Ser Sandauq Stillwater]], King Cheowald, ..., an elven woman with a scar over her face wearing a bright red cloak ([Myrmidia]]. There are hundreds, if not thousands, of these ghostly visages.
        - The dock extends itself outwards, her now heaving their typical armor and weapons. They feel a pull towards the rock of the bay, towards the throne and the [[Lady of Teeth]]. She follows the pull, somewhat resigned
        - A "green haired hag" shimmers as she approaches transforming into a beautiful woman, spinning a key with one bloodied hand while the other carries another item. Her hand covered in oath rings, so many that they're overlapping one another. She gives [[[Rory]] a small grin, her teeth sharp and crooked like the [Lady of Teeth]] also gives her a comfortable grin from atop of her throne.
        - Dialogue (most of)
            - [[Hair of Fire]], you were named for me."
            - [[Rory]]: "I don't even know who you are"
            - [[Hair of Fire]]: "Not many do. You've sworn part of an oath to me."
            - [[Rory]]: "Does it make you happy that I have basically given up my whole life for you?"
            - [[Hair of Fire]]: "Not exactly, but it does mean I have someone to bear the blade. Many of your fellow die quickly... After all, he had it for four days, she had it for two months, Chevyold had it for over half a century... It does not make me _happy_, but _because you did_... you gave up much and in return were given much... Power, the ability to protect others and fight enemies that would otherwise exceed you."
            - [[Rory]]: "To what end? Can somebody tell me what they want from me?!"
            - [[Hair of Fire]]"
            - [[Rory]]: "Who is that?"
            - [[Hair of Fire]] have been preventing her return. Everyone who bears the sword yields my edict."
            - ...
            - [[Hair of Fire]]: "My dear, you bear a shard of my soul. A shard of divinity within. You already happen to know my name."
            - [[Rory]]: "I don't need to know your name or who you are... Are you a good person? Am... Am I a good person."
            - [[Hair of Fire]] and her supporters gain more power."
            - [[[Rory]]: "You said that the [False Queen]] walks around in the world... How much influence in this war do you know she has?" Is she Harper? Harper == Queen?
            - [[Witch Queen]] when there is no living queen, what position must they hold to gain that influence? Seek the fourth church of the green knight. It is there you will find an answer you seek."
            - [[Witch Queen]]'s head for me. He's inconsequential now, but if he continues to live he shall not stay that way..."
            - The [[Witch Queen]]'s voice begins to fade, "Consider this the final warning."
- [[Greenbelt]] tells us where the dragon's hoard is, we go
- [[[Con'Niall|Niall]] almost dies to traps guarding the loot, going down multiple times... [Greenbelt]] set us up?!?
    - [[Session 39 Loot]]
- Blume does the same thing that he did for the [[Stag Lord]] for this dragon eye we found in the loot. The roots in his eye xenomorphing to grab the dragon's eye
    - Blume sees through another dragon's eye...
        - "You're playing a very dangerous game young Yllavaris, a very dangerous game" - THE draco-lich, 
    - Small scars where his eyelid was ripped apart
    - -2 to intelligence permanently until greater restoration
    - The eye is weak to hallowed places, beings, and items
- We go back to [[Lord Auril's Town]] and meet the merchants and townspeople that showed us off. They cannot believe that we are alive.
- We get a long rest and in the morning we get an urgent message from a courier...
    - The [[Nameless Company]] was summoned to the keep by the lady of the town. We are to go ASAP
    - There is a letter for us, craved from someone's skin. As we start to read it the doors behind us burst open. Three people burst in: [[Krusa]]
    - The "back-scroll" says:
        - A) He succeeded in taking what he aimed for. He wanted land. "Get good you motherfuckers".
        - B) These are the last living members of the head of [[Kaerliv]]:
            - [[Baronet, Lady Salrus]] are either dead or missing. They have all gone to hide in the quarry.
            - We lost brock, stint, chad, lary, and more from our company
            - [[Braum]]
            - 50% of the quarry population is dead, half of the actual nameless company is dead
        - Signed: The [[Stag Lord]] the entire time...

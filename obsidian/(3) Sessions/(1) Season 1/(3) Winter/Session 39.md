- Visions:
    - [Blume](https://crisis-of-crowns.games-with-friends.org/\(1\)-the-party/blume.html)
        - Acid smells from the former fight are replaced with the smells of a forest, compost, rotten trees, growth, etc. Opening his eyes, he finds himself in a forest
        - Following a deer path to a clearing on a hill. Sitting on it is the single largest tree [Blume](https://crisis-of-crowns.games-with-friends.org/\(1\)-the-party/blume.html) has ever seen
        - Multitude of faces, each with different emotions
            - "The chosen child seeks us out... Well, well... Lord Blume, brought before us to face the [False Queen](https://crisis-of-crowns.games-with-friends.org/\(2\)-campaign/entities/false-queen.html). You have suffered much in your young age and will continue, your troubles are not over... But know this..."
                - Every plant shivers and turns towards him, some growing more faces, all with open and shining eyes
            - "Know that we chose you for a reason... Too many voices were silent and too many will continue to be silenced... There are very few who practice the old ways and fewer who will survive what is coming.. Fewer still who will listen when called..."
                - Blume is called towards towards the tree, to a cave going under the tree
                - Inside there is a throne made out of tree roots, many bigger than actual tree trunks
                - The throne shrinks down to Blume size, he sits down in it and feels agony as his eye and leg is ripped off... The roots shiver and writhe as roots wrap around his leg and head..
            - "You are the chosen, of we who simply are... We who are ever-vigilant, we the many faces of knowledge, of the eldest of the eldest, the endless, do you accept this title?" He does. The roots of the chair grow into his leg with searing agony as a tendril of roots grows out from his leg too... The roots are shaping into a branch that has grown out of his leg. It looks like a peg-leg. These roots also dig into his eye as he blinks away blood. He sees himself for a split second. He blinks again, his old eye eaten and his new eye is moving white threads. On the left half of his face is horns of tree roots growing out of his forehead.
                - Rise, [Lord Blume, of the Eldest of Eldest, Champion of the Endless, Agent of the Green Coven](https://crisis-of-crowns.games-with-friends.org/\(1\)-the-party/blume.html)
                - Blinking again, he sees an emblem being stitched by the roots into his clothing
                    - An empty face, half smiling, half angry, a symbol of one of the [Green Coven](https://crisis-of-crowns.games-with-friends.org/\(2\)-campaign/factions/green-coven.html)
    - [[Con'Niall|Niall]]
        - As he dozes off, the smell of the bog and party talking fades. Opening his eyes again in an icy cave that has paintings and carvings of history that once was (peace, war, death, etc.).
        - In front of him is a small pathway he slowly makes his way down. At the end of this path is a large cavern, in the middle of it is a giant orc on a throne and sitting next to him is an absolutely massive green dragon curling around the throne. The orc is [Agrius](https://crisis-of-crowns.games-with-friends.org/\(2\)-campaign/entities/gods/agrius.html), the dragon [Greenbelt](https://crisis-of-crowns.games-with-friends.org/\(2\)-campaign/entities/greenbelt.html). [Agrius](https://crisis-of-crowns.games-with-friends.org/\(2\)-campaign/entities/gods/agrius.html) and [Greenbelt](https://crisis-of-crowns.games-with-friends.org/\(2\)-campaign/entities/greenbelt.html) are constantly shifting and transforming into different forms... [Niall](https://crisis-of-crowns.games-with-friends.org/\(1\)-the-party/con'niall.html) remembers tails of [Greenbelt](https://crisis-of-crowns.games-with-friends.org/\(2\)-campaign/entities/greenbelt.html) and [Agrius](https://crisis-of-crowns.games-with-friends.org/\(2\)-campaign/entities/gods/agrius.html), some being thousands of years old, each tale representing a different form of what he sees.
            - [Greenbelt](https://crisis-of-crowns.games-with-friends.org/\(2\)-campaign/entities/greenbelt.html) settles as a dragon with antlers and whiskers
            - Around the room sits 3 empty thrones. He realizes this is the same cavern as his last vision
        - Dialogue
            - [Agrius](https://crisis-of-crowns.games-with-friends.org/\(2\)-campaign/entities/gods/agrius.html): "You've done well... We've only had to give you a heart attack 3 times. The bar was on the ground and you managed not to trip. Good job."
            - [Greenbelt](https://crisis-of-crowns.games-with-friends.org/\(2\)-campaign/entities/greenbelt.html): You don't hear him talking, but echoing as if the world itself spoke. "You have one task ahead of you. After that you return to the [Wild Wood](https://crisis-of-crowns.games-with-friends.org/\(2\)-campaign/locations/lands/wild-wood.html) and take up its place as guardian. This is what you traded for me saving your people. Your days of adventuring are numbered. You have one more task that you chose, and then you are mine until you die. And even then..."
            - [Agrius](https://crisis-of-crowns.games-with-friends.org/\(2\)-campaign/entities/gods/agrius.html): "As an agent of the [Green Coven](https://crisis-of-crowns.games-with-friends.org/\(2\)-campaign/factions/green-coven.html), your task will be thus. At the end of the [Wild Wood](https://crisis-of-crowns.games-with-friends.org/\(2\)-campaign/locations/lands/wild-wood.html) is a gate. You shall guard that gate until you die. If you do not, the [False Queen](https://crisis-of-crowns.games-with-friends.org/\(2\)-campaign/entities/false-queen.html)'s followers can free her more easily. You shall guard the [3rd Gate of Sanatorius](https://crisis-of-crowns.games-with-friends.org/3rd Gate of Sanatorius). You will then become a warden of the [Wild Wood](https://crisis-of-crowns.games-with-friends.org/\(2\)-campaign/locations/lands/wild-wood.html). Do you accept?"
            - [Niall](https://crisis-of-crowns.games-with-friends.org/\(1\)-the-party/con'niall.html): "I do."
            - [Greenbelt](https://crisis-of-crowns.games-with-friends.org/\(2\)-campaign/entities/greenbelt.html): Chuckling, now in its smaller form. "Ehehehe... Excelent. Don't worry. It's a good job. We know you have an enemy to kill before you return. Take the time you need, but know that you can't take too long. By the winter equinox, you must be home." (3 months)
        - [Greenbelt](https://crisis-of-crowns.games-with-friends.org/\(2\)-campaign/entities/greenbelt.html) laughs as [Con'Niall](https://crisis-of-crowns.games-with-friends.org/\(1\)-the-party/con'niall.html) blinks, dragon scales growing up his leg eventually covering his cheek and his combat damaged eye & ear. The scales fade and he can see out of both eyes again... His jaw is now half almost-draconic, his other damaged features becoming dragon-like. His damaged hand is now a scaled claw...
            - [Con'Niall](https://crisis-of-crowns.games-with-friends.org/\(1\)-the-party/con'niall.html) gains a breath weapon, 15 ft cone, replaces an attack (not attack action, but an attack), damage is number of d6 equal to level, choose between psychic, poison, or thunder damage when used, once per short rest or by extending a hit die
        - [Agrius](https://crisis-of-crowns.games-with-friends.org/\(2\)-campaign/entities/gods/agrius.html) looks at [Con'Niall](https://crisis-of-crowns.games-with-friends.org/\(1\)-the-party/con'niall.html) one last time and says "Go forth, champion of the [Wild Wood](https://crisis-of-crowns.games-with-friends.org/\(2\)-campaign/locations/lands/wild-wood.html), [Agent of the Green Coven, Ser Con'Niall the Dragon Knight](https://crisis-of-crowns.games-with-friends.org/\(1\)-the-party/con'niall.html)
    - [Ghorza](https://crisis-of-crowns.games-with-friends.org/\(1\)-the-party/ghorza.html)
        - Smells of acid from the last fight slowly fade as she falls asleep. They are replaced by the tang of iron, mud, and steel. She finds herself on the top of a grassy hill, surveying out she sees thousands and thousands of weapons-- many of which are bloody and bent. She is circled by a barrier of blades, placed around her like a fence post.
            - She sees in front of her a roughly human woman in full plate mail, tear drop shaped shield, red cape and sash. Uncanny valley levels of near perfect looking except a terrifying large scar diagonally across her whole face. She is resting on her sword, staring out across the battle below. There are various campus here, similar to [Ghorza](https://crisis-of-crowns.games-with-friends.org/\(1\)-the-party/ghorza.html)'s last vision
            - [Ghorza](https://crisis-of-crowns.games-with-friends.org/\(1\)-the-party/ghorza.html) recognizes this woman as [Myrmidia](https://crisis-of-crowns.games-with-friends.org/\(2\)-campaign/entities/gods/the-three-siblings/myrmidia.html). Her form is constantly shifting as in [Con'Niall](https://crisis-of-crowns.games-with-friends.org/\(1\)-the-party/con'niall.html)'s vision. She wields a sword that is similar to [Rory](https://crisis-of-crowns.games-with-friends.org/\(1\)-the-party/rory.html)'s [Oathblade](https://crisis-of-crowns.games-with-friends.org/\(2\)-campaign/misc/oathblade.html) (it is the same sword)
        - Dialogue
            - [Myrmidia](https://crisis-of-crowns.games-with-friends.org/\(2\)-campaign/entities/gods/the-three-siblings/myrmidia.html): "Well, you have had quite the adventure [Ghorza](https://crisis-of-crowns.games-with-friends.org/\(1\)-the-party/ghorza.html)..." She says looking at [Ghorza](https://crisis-of-crowns.games-with-friends.org/\(1\)-the-party/ghorza.html), "Wouldn't you say you had fun?"
            - [Ghorza](https://crisis-of-crowns.games-with-friends.org/\(1\)-the-party/ghorza.html) does not really agree it was fun :)
            - [Myrmidia](https://crisis-of-crowns.games-with-friends.org/\(2\)-campaign/entities/gods/the-three-siblings/myrmidia.html): "Good. War is not fun. But you have fought for the right reasons. To protect, honor.. And now I ask, will you fight to serve?"
            - [Ghorza](https://crisis-of-crowns.games-with-friends.org/\(1\)-the-party/ghorza.html): "Yes"
                - Two tall orcish men appear next to her, one wearing armor and one wearing a wolf pelt. The two of them shifting as [Myrmidia](https://crisis-of-crowns.games-with-friends.org/\(2\)-campaign/entities/gods/the-three-siblings/myrmidia.html) is. The one in plate male is [Lydesh](https://crisis-of-crowns.games-with-friends.org/\(2\)-campaign/entities/gods/the-three-siblings/lydesh.html), the other being [Agrius](https://crisis-of-crowns.games-with-friends.org/\(2\)-campaign/entities/gods/agrius.html). More beings appear, a large green dragon, a giant bear ([Rkto](https://crisis-of-crowns.games-with-friends.org/\(2\)-campaign/entities/ancients/rkto.html)), an ancient man with a cane ([Richard](https://crisis-of-crowns.games-with-friends.org/\(2\)-campaign/entities/gods/richard.html)),
            - [Myrmidia](https://crisis-of-crowns.games-with-friends.org/\(2\)-campaign/entities/gods/the-three-siblings/myrmidia.html): "Every step of your journey you have met friends, companions... Three of your traveling companions have been tasked with protecting the mortal realm from the [False Queen](https://crisis-of-crowns.games-with-friends.org/\(2\)-campaign/entities/false-queen.html). You would honor me if you would join them. And you would honor me if you would do so in my name."
            - [Myrmidia](https://crisis-of-crowns.games-with-friends.org/\(2\)-campaign/entities/gods/the-three-siblings/myrmidia.html): "[Ghorza Morn](https://crisis-of-crowns.games-with-friends.org/\(1\)-the-party/ghorza.html), by your name, by your oath, do you swear to protect the realm from the [False Queen](https://crisis-of-crowns.games-with-friends.org/\(2\)-campaign/entities/false-queen.html)'s invasion. Do you swear to guard the realm of men, woman, and children from all who would seek it harm? ... Kneel."
            - [Ghorza](https://crisis-of-crowns.games-with-friends.org/\(1\)-the-party/ghorza.html): "I swear."
            - [Myrmidia](https://crisis-of-crowns.games-with-friends.org/\(2\)-campaign/entities/gods/the-three-siblings/myrmidia.html): "Take up your axe." An emblem of [Myrmidia](https://crisis-of-crowns.games-with-friends.org/\(2\)-campaign/entities/gods/the-three-siblings/myrmidia.html) is engraved on her axe now. "Arise [Ser Ghorza Morn, Daughter of the Bloode](https://crisis-of-crowns.games-with-friends.org/\(1\)-the-party/ghorza.html), Daughter by blood, chosen by choice"
        - [Ghorza](https://crisis-of-crowns.games-with-friends.org/\(1\)-the-party/ghorza.html) sees a vision of when [Myrmidia](https://crisis-of-crowns.games-with-friends.org/\(2\)-campaign/entities/gods/the-three-siblings/myrmidia.html) was once a mortal. Her daughter founded [Ghorza](https://crisis-of-crowns.games-with-friends.org/\(1\)-the-party/ghorza.html)'s clan.
        - Among all of these visages of people that appeared is a relatively small bear that approaches her. "Well met [Ser Ghorza](https://crisis-of-crowns.games-with-friends.org/\(1\)-the-party/ghorza.html). You know me by my title of the she bear. I would ask a favor while we are all here... If your party is willing, I would ask that you come visit me. I have need of some assistance. Lord [Blume](https://crisis-of-crowns.games-with-friends.org/\(1\)-the-party/blume.html) must speak of the deal we once made.... I understand that you have stag to hunt. Come visit beforehand." She leans in, touching her nose to [Ghorza](https://crisis-of-crowns.games-with-friends.org/\(1\)-the-party/ghorza.html)'s head.
            - [Ghorza](https://crisis-of-crowns.games-with-friends.org/\(1\)-the-party/ghorza.html) learns her name, [Rkto](https://crisis-of-crowns.games-with-friends.org/\(2\)-campaign/entities/ancients/rkto.html)
        - Gains
            - [Ghorza](https://crisis-of-crowns.games-with-friends.org/\(1\)-the-party/ghorza.html) increases her CHA to 13 and can multi-class into paladin
            - One time, she may cast a 3rd level bless without concentration
    - [Cassia](https://crisis-of-crowns.games-with-friends.org/\(1\)-the-party/cassia.html)
        - Acid fight smells replaced by the smells of her home as she opens her eyes.
        - She sees three figures standing in front of her: Antlered figure: [Drasil](https://crisis-of-crowns.games-with-friends.org/\(2\)-campaign/entities/gods/drasil.html), gorgeous woman with earthen brown skin and moss green hair: [Posaunia](https://crisis-of-crowns.games-with-friends.org/\(2\)-campaign/entities/gods/posaunia.html), gaunt skinny elf with shock white hair, golden eyes, and a scythe he uses as a walking stick: [Rhydahn](https://crisis-of-crowns.games-with-friends.org/\(2\)-campaign/entities/gods/rhydahn.html)
        - Dialogue
            - [Drasil](https://crisis-of-crowns.games-with-friends.org/\(2\)-campaign/entities/gods/drasil.html): "You're a long way from home, aren't you [Cassia](https://crisis-of-crowns.games-with-friends.org/\(1\)-the-party/cassia.html)?", he says almost jokingly with a shit eating grin. "You've come a long way, but not as far as you'd like have you?" He walks forward, shrinking down to just below [Cassia](https://crisis-of-crowns.games-with-friends.org/\(1\)-the-party/cassia.html)'s height. "You may not have done as much as you wanted, but you have done enough... But I would ask you do more. Not because you have not done enough, but I know that you can do more. The wheat shall continue to grow and be threshed as it has been done since mortality began... But I would see your stalk go uncut for longer"
            - [Drasil](https://crisis-of-crowns.games-with-friends.org/\(2\)-campaign/entities/gods/drasil.html) appears as half human, half rotting human. He reaches out with his rotting hand and grabs [Cassia](https://crisis-of-crowns.games-with-friends.org/\(1\)-the-party/cassia.html)'s damaged hand. Using his scythe he slashes at her hand. She blinks and looks down, now missing her hand, replaced with a golden sickle (+1 moon sickle)
                - Replaces the last line with: When you cast a leveled spell that damages a target that has no soul, increase the damage die by one. Soul-less creatures are most constructs, most undead, and a number of aberrations
            - [Drasil](https://crisis-of-crowns.games-with-friends.org/\(2\)-campaign/entities/gods/drasil.html): "A gift. Use it well. The chaff (soul-less beings) must be removed from the threshing floor." He gives her a smile, half rotting, meant to be nice and compassionate. "Your work is not done. You face a foe, soon, who has escaped _me_. Do not let him escape you." [Cassia](https://crisis-of-crowns.games-with-friends.org/\(1\)-the-party/cassia.html) blinks and [Rhydahn](https://crisis-of-crowns.games-with-friends.org/\(2\)-campaign/entities/gods/rhydahn.html) vanishes
            - [Posaunia](https://crisis-of-crowns.games-with-friends.org/\(2\)-campaign/entities/gods/posaunia.html) and [Drasil](https://crisis-of-crowns.games-with-friends.org/\(2\)-campaign/entities/gods/drasil.html): "Our son has said much. We have but one or two more additions. It is on you and yours to kill that False Stage. We expect it. You have all been given gifts far beyond the measure of many so called adventurers of this land. We expect these investments returned. Amongst your companions, there are those chosen by ancient magic, ancient beings, gods... and you... A priestess of the green faith favored by death itself." [Drasil](https://crisis-of-crowns.games-with-friends.org/\(2\)-campaign/entities/gods/drasil.html) and [Posaunia](https://crisis-of-crowns.games-with-friends.org/\(2\)-campaign/entities/gods/posaunia.html) shift into a stag with a vulture on it. The stag snorts, and [Cassia](https://crisis-of-crowns.games-with-friends.org/\(1\)-the-party/cassia.html) hears the world speaking. "We are the gods of death, life, and the cycle itself. Do not fail to uphold that cycle."
        - [Cassia](https://crisis-of-crowns.games-with-friends.org/\(1\)-the-party/cassia.html) blinks, environment changing into a glowing yellow field of wheat in every direction flowing by an unfelt wind. She feels a brief peace before the vision ends. She recognizes this as the [Field of Wheat](https://crisis-of-crowns.games-with-friends.org/\(2\)-campaign/locations/field-of-wheat.html).
        - Her left eye is now gold, her hair also gaining a golden supernatural tinge. Also eligible for a multi-class in death-cleric. Honorary member of the [Stalwart Wardens](https://crisis-of-crowns.games-with-friends.org/Stalwart Wardens)
    - [Rory](https://crisis-of-crowns.games-with-friends.org/\(1\)-the-party/rory.html)
        - Curling up wrapped around sword, blinking before awakening to a familiar smell of sea spray. They are sitting on the edge of a pier, staring out into the [Bay of Crabs](https://crisis-of-crowns.games-with-friends.org/\(0\)-obsidian_stuff/_uncategorized/bay-of-crabs.html) in the village she was raised in. They blink, buildings smoking, bodies littering the ground.. They blink again, back on the bench... It's normal? Again. Looking out, dozen of ships on fire, screams of men. Again... Just a bay, sitting on a bench
        - She sees a kind of ugly woman with bright red hair, relatively long hooked nose, green-ish skin (think witch), in one hand is a sword length item wrapped in cloth, in her other hand is her sharpened nails and a human heart with blood dripping down. She throws the heart into the water and [Rory](https://crisis-of-crowns.games-with-friends.org/\(1\)-the-party/rory.html) sees the violent scene briefly once again. Another woman walks closer into view, the [Lady of Teeth](https://crisis-of-crowns.games-with-friends.org/\(2\)-campaign/entities/fey/lady-of-teeth.html).
        - Walking out of the bay is hundreds of half incorporeal figures walking out of the water. For a split second, [Ser Sandauq Stillwater](https://crisis-of-crowns.games-with-friends.org/\(2\)-campaign/people/ser-sandauq-stillwater.html), King Cheowald, ..., an elven woman with a scar over her face wearing a bright red cloak ([Myrmidia](https://crisis-of-crowns.games-with-friends.org/\(2\)-campaign/entities/gods/the-three-siblings/myrmidia.html)), sandy blond haired human man (she thinks he's [Flint](https://crisis-of-crowns.games-with-friends.org/\(2\)-campaign/people/flint.html)). There are hundreds, if not thousands, of these ghostly visages.
        - The dock extends itself outwards, her now heaving their typical armor and weapons. They feel a pull towards the rock of the bay, towards the throne and the [Lady of Teeth](https://crisis-of-crowns.games-with-friends.org/\(2\)-campaign/entities/fey/lady-of-teeth.html). She follows the pull, somewhat resigned
        - A "green haired hag" shimmers as she approaches transforming into a beautiful woman, spinning a key with one bloodied hand while the other carries another item. Her hand covered in oath rings, so many that they're overlapping one another. She gives [Rory](https://crisis-of-crowns.games-with-friends.org/\(1\)-the-party/rory.html) a small grin, her teeth sharp and crooked like the [Lady of Teeth](https://crisis-of-crowns.games-with-friends.org/\(2\)-campaign/entities/fey/lady-of-teeth.html). The actual [Lady of Teeth](https://crisis-of-crowns.games-with-friends.org/\(2\)-campaign/entities/fey/lady-of-teeth.html) also gives her a comfortable grin from atop of her throne.
        - Dialogue (most of)
            - [Hair of Fire](https://crisis-of-crowns.games-with-friends.org/\(2\)-campaign/entities/fey/witch-queen.html): "Welcome [Ser Rory](https://crisis-of-crowns.games-with-friends.org/\(1\)-the-party/rory.html), you were named for me."
            - [Rory](https://crisis-of-crowns.games-with-friends.org/\(1\)-the-party/rory.html): "I don't even know who you are"
            - [Hair of Fire](https://crisis-of-crowns.games-with-friends.org/\(2\)-campaign/entities/fey/witch-queen.html): "Not many do. You've sworn part of an oath to me."
            - [Rory](https://crisis-of-crowns.games-with-friends.org/\(1\)-the-party/rory.html): "Does it make you happy that I have basically given up my whole life for you?"
            - [Hair of Fire](https://crisis-of-crowns.games-with-friends.org/\(2\)-campaign/entities/fey/witch-queen.html): "Not exactly, but it does mean I have someone to bear the blade. Many of your fellow die quickly... After all, he had it for four days, she had it for two months, Chevyold had it for over half a century... It does not make me _happy_, but _because you did_... you gave up much and in return were given much... Power, the ability to protect others and fight enemies that would otherwise exceed you."
            - [Rory](https://crisis-of-crowns.games-with-friends.org/\(1\)-the-party/rory.html): "To what end? Can somebody tell me what they want from me?!"
            - [Hair of Fire](https://crisis-of-crowns.games-with-friends.org/\(2\)-campaign/entities/fey/witch-queen.html): "Yes, it is in your oath young lady... You are to guard the seals of the [False Queen](https://crisis-of-crowns.games-with-friends.org/\(2\)-campaign/entities/false-queen.html)"
            - [Rory](https://crisis-of-crowns.games-with-friends.org/\(1\)-the-party/rory.html): "Who is that?"
            - [Hair of Fire](https://crisis-of-crowns.games-with-friends.org/\(2\)-campaign/entities/fey/witch-queen.html): The person on the throne shimmers, a paper white skinned elf coming into view with raven black hair and chains embedded in her flesh. "The [False Queen](https://crisis-of-crowns.games-with-friends.org/\(2\)-campaign/entities/false-queen.html) was a would-be arch-fey that attempted to end mortal life multiple times. She cannot be killed. All we can do is make sure she cannot get out, or at least all of her power... Her soul has been freed. She walks the mortal plans as of about 4 years ago. Myself and my fellows (the [Green Coven](https://crisis-of-crowns.games-with-friends.org/\(2\)-campaign/factions/green-coven.html)) have been preventing her return. Everyone who bears the sword yields my edict."
            - ...
            - [Hair of Fire](https://crisis-of-crowns.games-with-friends.org/\(2\)-campaign/entities/fey/witch-queen.html): "My dear, you bear a shard of my soul. A shard of divinity within. You already happen to know my name."
            - [Rory](https://crisis-of-crowns.games-with-friends.org/\(1\)-the-party/rory.html): "I don't need to know your name or who you are... Are you a good person? Am... Am I a good person."
            - [Hair of Fire](https://crisis-of-crowns.games-with-friends.org/\(2\)-campaign/entities/fey/witch-queen.html): "Yes. Would I have ordered you to protect others as in your oath if I was not? ... I am good, just not nice by it... After you fight the [Stag Lord](https://crisis-of-crowns.games-with-friends.org/\(2\)-campaign/entities/stag-lord.html), I have a true direct task for you. I need you to travel north towards the capital. The situation in the capital is getting more dire as the [False Queen](https://crisis-of-crowns.games-with-friends.org/\(2\)-campaign/entities/false-queen.html) and her supporters gain more power."
            - [Rory](https://crisis-of-crowns.games-with-friends.org/\(1\)-the-party/rory.html): "You said that the [False Queen](https://crisis-of-crowns.games-with-friends.org/\(2\)-campaign/entities/false-queen.html) walks around in the world... How much influence in this war do you know she has?" Is she Harper? Harper == Queen?
            - [Witch Queen](https://crisis-of-crowns.games-with-friends.org/\(2\)-campaign/entities/fey/witch-queen.html): "I can't tell you more. I have rules I must follow. And I can only be so direct on occasion. I must be vague. The rules of these visions... Even I must abide by. For someone to be a [False Queen](https://crisis-of-crowns.games-with-friends.org/\(2\)-campaign/entities/false-queen.html) when there is no living queen, what position must they hold to gain that influence? Seek the fourth church of the green knight. It is there you will find an answer you seek."
            - [Witch Queen](https://crisis-of-crowns.games-with-friends.org/\(2\)-campaign/entities/fey/witch-queen.html): "I am known by many titles. But I have only even borne one name, and I'll give you a hint: Think of the Towns". She reaches and puts a bloody hand on [Sentinel](https://crisis-of-crowns.games-with-friends.org/\(3\)-sessions/\(0\)-loot/\(2\)-important-items/oathblades/sentinel.html). The steel ripples, slowly turning a pink-ish red and rippled like water droplets in a pond. The blade seems a little longer and sturdier. The blade is now rounded at the tip and has a slight pink-red tint to the entire sword... Absorbing the ability of the magicians judge (dispel magic once per day). "I am the first of witches, the patron of the first witch, the first teacher of the old ways. We have taken much interest in your group. Use that as you will. Our time is almost ended, be a dear and remove the [Stag Lord](https://crisis-of-crowns.games-with-friends.org/\(2\)-campaign/entities/stag-lord.html)'s head for me. He's inconsequential now, but if he continues to live he shall not stay that way..."
            - The [Witch Queen](https://crisis-of-crowns.games-with-friends.org/\(2\)-campaign/entities/fey/witch-queen.html)'s voice begins to fade, "Consider this the final warning."
- [Greenbelt](https://crisis-of-crowns.games-with-friends.org/\(2\)-campaign/entities/greenbelt.html) tells us where the dragon's hoard is, we go
- [Con'Niall](https://crisis-of-crowns.games-with-friends.org/\(1\)-the-party/con'niall.html) almost dies to traps guarding the loot, going down multiple times... [Greenbelt](https://crisis-of-crowns.games-with-friends.org/\(2\)-campaign/entities/greenbelt.html) set us up?!?
    - [Session 39 Loot](https://crisis-of-crowns.games-with-friends.org/\(3\)-sessions/\(0\)-loot/\(1\)-session-loot/session-39-loot.html)
- Blume does the same thing that he did for the [Stag Lord](https://crisis-of-crowns.games-with-friends.org/\(2\)-campaign/entities/stag-lord.html) for this dragon eye we found in the loot. The roots in his eye xenomorphing to grab the dragon's eye
    - Blume sees through another dragon's eye...
        - "You're playing a very dangerous game young Yllavaris, a very dangerous game" - THE draco-lich, [Mygath](https://crisis-of-crowns.games-with-friends.org/\(2\)-campaign/entities/ancients/mygath.html)
    - Small scars where his eyelid was ripped apart
    - -2 to intelligence permanently until greater restoration
    - The eye is weak to hallowed places, beings, and items
- We go back to [Lord Auril's Town](https://crisis-of-crowns.games-with-friends.org/\(2\)-campaign/locations/cities/lord-auril's-town.html) and meet the merchants and townspeople that showed us off. They cannot believe that we are alive.
- We get a long rest and in the morning we get an urgent message from a courier...
    - The [Nameless Company](https://crisis-of-crowns.games-with-friends.org/\(1\)-the-party/nameless-company.html) was summoned to the keep by the lady of the town. We are to go ASAP
    - There is a letter for us, craved from someone's skin. As we start to read it the doors behind us burst open. Three people burst in: [Krusa](https://crisis-of-crowns.games-with-friends.org/\(2\)-campaign/people/krusa.html), [Ser George](https://crisis-of-crowns.games-with-friends.org/\(2\)-campaign/people/ser-george.html), [Sister Minorah](https://crisis-of-crowns.games-with-friends.org/\(2\)-campaign/people/sister-minorah.html)
    - The "back-scroll" says:
        - A) He succeeded in taking what he aimed for. He wanted land. "Get good you motherfuckers".
        - B) These are the last living members of the head of [Kaerliv](https://crisis-of-crowns.games-with-friends.org/\(2\)-campaign/locations/cities/kaerliv.html):
            - [Baronet, Lady Salrus](https://crisis-of-crowns.games-with-friends.org/\(2\)-campaign/people/baronet,-lady-salrus.html), [Ser Danal](https://crisis-of-crowns.games-with-friends.org/\(2\)-campaign/people/ser-danal.html), [Jack Scratch](https://crisis-of-crowns.games-with-friends.org/\(2\)-campaign/people/jack-scratch.html), Head of orphanage, old orc of the forge, Brian the rocktopuss..... all dead.... 2/3rds of the people of [Kaerliv](https://crisis-of-crowns.games-with-friends.org/\(2\)-campaign/locations/cities/kaerliv.html) and [The Quarry](https://crisis-of-crowns.games-with-friends.org/\(2\)-campaign/locations/poi/the-quarry.html) are either dead or missing. They have all gone to hide in the quarry.
            - We lost brock, stint, chad, lary, and more from our company
            - [Braum](https://crisis-of-crowns.games-with-friends.org/\(2\)-campaign/people/braum.html) is acting now as [Ser George](https://crisis-of-crowns.games-with-friends.org/\(2\)-campaign/people/ser-george.html)'s actual squire, and [Milo](https://crisis-of-crowns.games-with-friends.org/\(2\)-campaign/people/milo.html) (now missing) was acting as a page for [Lady Thissleblack](https://crisis-of-crowns.games-with-friends.org/\(2\)-campaign/people/lady-thissleblack.html)
            - 50% of the quarry population is dead, half of the actual nameless company is dead

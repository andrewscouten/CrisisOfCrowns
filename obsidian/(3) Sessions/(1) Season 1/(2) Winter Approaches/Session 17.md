> Reading book bound in human skin, written in blood ([[Con'Niall]], [[Finnegean]], [[Blume]])

- Bound in human skin, written in blood
- None of us can read the book, but it feels evil...  It's not knowledge to be known
	- Language of [[Gehenna]] - the Abyss & Hells

> Reading journal bound in human skin ([[Blume]], [[Con'Niall]])

- On normal paper with normal ink
- Written in [[Orcish]], [[Dwarvish]], [[Gehenna]], then the language changes, and keeps changing
- It's a telling of events over time
	- This journal was written by different members of a clan with help of [[The Woman in Armor]]
	- Details plans of raids, entrenchment in land, etc.
		- They want to falsify allegiances trying to start conflicts
	- Bits and pieces of [[The Plan of Sacrifice]]
		- They are foot soldiers, not the architects; [[The Woman in Armor]] is also probably the same
		- If we don't stop them, more bad things will happen
	- [[The Woman in Armor]] needs 4 more bodies, we have been tasked with finding them
	- More recruitment is necessary as the boss takes out their own men
	- [[The First]] - [[Krusa]] was working for them: [[Stag Lord]]

> We encounter the drake on the way back to the quarry

- [[Finnegean]] suggests that it leaves us alone, it does.

> We come across a house in a clearing

- We see arrows shot into trees, a house with a stable, mule, pigs, & garden
- [[Con'Niall]] goes to the house to investigate, sees goblin leather hanged up outside
	- The owner comes out, lil angry.. named...maybe [[Richard]]
	- [[Con'Niall]] mentions [[Greenbelt]], and we are asked to come inside; they offer momentary rest
- They picked off some goblins before they entrenched themselves & formed a partnership with 3 orgs
	- "Idiotic bandit group, raiding town south of us" - [[Krusa]]'s group
	- [[Cult of the Blood]]
	- Recently another group has joined... "An envoy of one of the local houses". [[House Tallmadge]]
- This person is at least 100 years old... They knew the old king that was dreamed of in [[Session 16]]

> Rory talks to our new friends about the sword

- [[Rory]] shows them the sword
- Daren did not know who it belonged to, and they don't either
- It had a full handle, it was a little less broken but not by much
- They have not seen the sword in at least 300 years
	- "That sword is older than I am..."
- Anyone who is versed in [[The Old Faith]] has heard of this person
	- He is [[Old Man Richard]], the first human [[Elder Spirit]]
	- He is at least 5,000 years old
	- An elderly figure who appears in time of need, someone who gave wisdom and guidance, etc. Has founded a dozen different houses...
	- His wife very rarely referred to by name, but by [[Granny]]
- Rory asks many questions
	- Daren had no children that they know of
	- "You bear an [[Oathblade]], this magic has been old for time immoral. Much of it has faded. There were once perhaps 2-3 dozen similar blades, borne by different types of people. Some were heroic mythic figures, other sell swords... All of them held one truth, they were [[Oathsworn]]. The oath depends on the blade and bearer"
		- [[Rory]] promised the woman on her deathbed that she would give it back to its owner
	- "You are both the daughter of a knight and the daughter of a noble"
		- A knight was told to protect his friends daughter... just in case they could not...
	- "Your mother had many enemies... It's very hard to raise a child that people will exploit"
	- She is alive, last the knew... Hasn't been seen in years, but last seen was a high-ranking advisor (3-4 years ago)
		- Recently recovering from assassination attempts
	- "That sword... even I can tell was recently broken further. When Daren wielded it, it never repaired itself for 30 years."
		- Daren was last seen "wasting away" in a keep on [[The Bay of Crabs]] near the town of [[Antlers]]
	- "You are the daughter of two ancient families. There are those that look upon your journey."
	- "Daughter of [[Eret]] and [[Breon]]..."
	- "There were 3 other wielders in history of your [[Oathblade]]"
		- [[Daren the Greenblood]]
		- [[Ser Sandauq Stillwater]] - 1 century before Daren, more of a blink in history
		- Baronet [[Sarusia Blackmont]] (related to [[Ser Leona Blackmont]]) - 3 centuries before Sandauq 
		- [[King Corewin Ceowale]] - 4.5k years ago

> The Old Man Richard turns to [[Con'Niall]]

- It's not often [[The Old Magic]] intervenes... We will be watching with interest....
- Only [[Con'Niall]] hears in his head - "It is not often that the green lord meets new mortals and enjoys their company so much... We offer you a gift out of continued 'interest'..."
- "You will be quite the interest to those that need extra entertainment... You do not know the old ways, but you can guide them..."
	- Thumb to forehead, draws a line down to the nose
- Soul of the storm giant feat

> Granny talks to Blume

- There are influences over Blume: Rkto, the king green, the moonlit queen, a few others, one of whom is not to be name. The blooming prince is interested as well
- 3 statues; nondescript elderly man, nondescript humanoid older lady, what appears to be a statue but is a petrified tree with the face of a snarling demon carved into the stone
- +1 Occultist Rite: Oracle Divine Miracle
- "Rkto sends their regards *gunshot*"

> Granny talks to [[Finnegean]]

- "Tell me, why do you stay with them? ..... Or, will you run away like last time... or the time before"
- "This company you keep has many eyes on it, it is nice to know you will have your eyes on them"
- "..... Will you stay?"; Finnegean says maybe?
- She thinks he is what we is right now as a group, a light and darkness
- A gift, for your time: Places a small cup of tea in front of him

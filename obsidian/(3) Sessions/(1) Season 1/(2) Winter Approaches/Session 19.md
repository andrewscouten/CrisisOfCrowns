> Shopping / Information Gathering

- We all did some shopping in town, selling stuff, upgrading armor and weapons (including horse armor)
- Talked to [[Baronet, Lady Salrus]], got some money, secured some food & supplies for the quarry, identified some spell scrolls and items
	- She did not like the flesh spell books
	- She met [[Con'Niall]] for the first time, [[Finnegean]] officially joins the company along with Niall.
- We look around the town for people that might want to come to the quarry
- There are 3 people heading north by north east to [[Ravenskeep]], all of which are skilled workers
	- We might see them on the road to the necromancer ?
	- Glass blower, carpenter, tinkerer
- Stables to the east and west to buy a horse at, people in [[Kaerliv]] cannot afford to sell them
- We want to go to Boar's head to get more supplies for the quarry eventually, which is north west
- We were able to recruit 11 people for the mines
- [1 gold 30 silver in the group bank account]

	- He's been training & training people of our company
	- [[Rory]]'s mom was last seen by George in the southern-most portion of the [[Basilisk Isles]]. She went "back to the mainland".
	- Spy in the service of the now extinct [[House Gogorias Valdor]]
		- Last stewards of Ashfall, where the past king deleted house valdor who were slavers... a pervious war
	- Formerly worked for the king of that house, and therefore could not stay with her child
- Her dad's name was [[Ser Flint the Beggar]]. He was killed defending [[Rory]] and her mom. Her dad was an orphan, much like [[Ser George]].
	- They met on a contract  

> We are in combat

- We walk towards the necromancer's area, where a mummy and a lot of skeletons fight us
- The mummy downs Rory, and she gets cursed where she cannot get healed past stable

- Fear ensues

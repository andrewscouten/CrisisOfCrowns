		- Hear the same deeper voice from his first dream; rock falls, waves, trees
		- "Grow. We've got our eye on you for a reason. Grow young Blume. Let us see how the garden looks."
		- The images now go in reverse, as if falling; awaken with sap on her tongue
	- [[Rory]]

		- She sees a few hot springs, and between them there's a stone

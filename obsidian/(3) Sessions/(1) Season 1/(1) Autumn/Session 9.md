- [[Novamere]] takes some time to himself in the forest to unwind and process what happened
- [[Selene]] wonders into the forest, never to be seen again
	- Just kidding, she spends time there doing random things (originally in search of the Tree man from [[Session 8]])
	- She hears the crack of a vine above her, it gives her a little scroll with a red bow on top tied up by brambles
	- Inside is a ring... She puts it on without checking with anyone who knows magic D: 
		- May her gods protect her
		- They kinda did? The ring feels like divine magic in some way, but different than her divine magic. 
			- "Similar to a minor boon, like if a cleric were to get a minor boon from a god"
			- [Ring of Ensnarement]
				- People of her faith will recognize her as favored by her gods

				- May expend 1 charge to cast the spell [Ensnaring Strike] with a spell save DC of 13

	- 200 ish pounds of lumber, some other odds and ends
- A bit into the road, we hear the snarling of a large beast

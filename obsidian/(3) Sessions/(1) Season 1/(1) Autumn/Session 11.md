- We see some eyes around the perimeter of the necromancer's camp / area
- We try to help [[Jack Scratch]] with various methods
	- Blume does not recognize this curse as old magic
	- Selene does not see anything physically wrong with him, or any ritualized scaring
	- His growing distance between the town and the necromancer's area is causing him to grow weak. Exhaustion will end up killing him if something is not done.
	- "Novamere gets crop dusted by his god" - Marlo. 
		- "... We can fix this" he hears to his side
		- Holy water will remove the curse from within him, as the curse was forced down his throat
		- Novamere has an awakening?
	- Novamere prays to his god in desperation, his god creates holy water from his flask
	- He feeds it to Jack and it helps heal him of some of the curse
		- He was unable to sleep previously, but now he can. One of his eyes returns to normal, but one is still showing signs of a curse
- We arrive at town after long discussion
- Novamere buys & makes ingredients for more holy water
- Blume determines the curse is not of the old ways, arcane, or Druidic magic
- We all buy / barter for some winter gear, some people look fancier than others

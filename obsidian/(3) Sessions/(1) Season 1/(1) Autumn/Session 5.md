- We are hanging around [[Lady Thissleblack]]'s house
    - We see some notes written not by her on the wall
        - " we have taken the lady, hurry up and meet us there"
    - [[Lady Thissleblack]] gives [[Blume]] some tutoring
- Cut to [[Fyudor]] and [[Ghorza]]
    - They need to scare something away, not kill it
        - "They are they way, goodbye"
    - They find the kobold
        - Kobold: "Why are you here"
        - [[Ghorza]]: "... Why are you here?"
            - Why is Gamora
        - The kobold has thumbs, and lives there. The evil [[Ghorza]] and [[Fyudor]] are there to evict him
    - They evict the poor man for not playing property tax
    - They get a map of the area we're in as a reward
- There's a knock at the door, and we see [[Ghorza]] and [[Fyudor]]!
    - They give the map to [[Rory]] and [[Novamere]] to decipher
        - They see a few small clearings on the map about a few days from each other
        - One location is the radish patch we were in previously
        - Other 2 are unknown
        - On the back of the map: "Some hidden locations, once lost. You find now. - G"
- [[Lady Thissleblack]] will be back into town before us probably, and will tell them of our deeds
- The party of 2 missing guards is probably dead
- [[Novamere]] is probably traumatized by this ordeal of him needing a cure :)
- We talk to [[Lady Thissleblack]] about the [Bodies missing in graveyard] ([[Objectives]])
    - Some people about a week away, straight north, newcomers [one is probably a necromancer] <- missing bodies sound like a recipe for something they would want
        - In the [[North Wood]], they are 3-4 days away now probably! We should stop by the town first
    - Sometimes woods witches take bodies (she doesn't know of anyone else, and she didn't do it)
    - Goblin camp is further away then the necromancer (more north)
    - [[Rory]] is called [[Rory|Aurora]]
    - [[Lady Thissleblack]] takes [[Rory]] and [[Blume]] to another location
        - Dead husk of a tree that is long dead
        - [[Rory]] does not know our ways yet
        - Soft floating light is glowing away inside the tree, whistles of wind
        - Soft mulch ground, tree trunk is as wide as a table
        - Light settles on [[Rory]]'s arm, feels different than a wisp in the woods; feels comforting
        - "We are those that are, and those that have been for a very long time. You have been blessed by us, let's see if you are worthy."
            - "I promise you I'm not"
- We sneak attacked a group of bandits
    - Killed them, there are 3 known locations that our prisoner knows of
    - There's one close, south-ish
        - "Who is the leader of the camp?"
            - She can be identified by her weapon, same quality of [[Ghorza]]'s axe, hand-axe probably
            - She has 5 of them
        - We were on our way to this camp????
        - It used to be a trading post
            - Taken over by blue tatzelwurms
    - Leader of the bandits at large, not just this camp
        - The have a stag head
        - The leader, [[Stag Lord]], also calls himself
            - [Lord of all the hills in the wood]
            - [Master of the horned fort] <- never heard of this place
            - [First of the freemen] <- "First of the bandits" / "King of the bandits" essentially
        - He is getting bandits in the region under his control. He has some as far as a month's travel away
        - His control down south is unknown, but in this area every bandit calls him lord
        - He is a drunk, doesn't usually leave his fort
        - Maybe not a member of the cult of blood yet, but his generals are
    - There were other towns attacked
        - One is a large distance north of here
    - We went to go investigate the bandit camp closest to us, before going back to town

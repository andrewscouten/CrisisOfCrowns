        - "You need to leave (eventually), so we do not attract more trouble"
    - She will post bounties overnight and we will be able to see them in the morning

        - We get rooms paid for while we're here, but the destroyed homes make the inn a little packed. We do however rest.
- [[Fyudor]] falls into an exhaustive sleep; awakens in his room
    - The room is empty, he feels the feeling of [his skin getting scratched but from the inside of the ribcage]. Something is inside of him, trying to claw its way out.
    - Hears growling, cold breath, before everything returning to normal
    - His hands have his blood on them, from clutching his palms in his sleep
- [[Selene]] also falls into a slumber
    - She blinks her eyes and she's standing in a field of flowers
        - It's very pretty, but you can tell this was once a battlefield
        - There's a structure off in the distance, it's hazy as if in a mirage
    - She carefully makes her way towards the structure
        - It's almost as if she can walk through the ex-battlefield, unbothered
        - As she starts to near the structure-- now looking like her [[Selene's Temple]], she hears a voice
            - "Not yet my child, you are not ready. Your persistence will bloom"

        - Hearing words, but almost as if earth itself is speaking (1)
        - 1. "Stay out of this man, you shall not claim him"
        - 2. "You are a fool, I already have"
        - 1. "What you have can be easily stripped away. You are nothing in our eyes, and you shall take nothing"
        - 2. "Enough of this petty squabble, we are above this"
        - 1. "You shall not have the last word..."

    - She stands up, reaches for her axe that's not there; no people, the village is abandoned as if it was left minutes ago

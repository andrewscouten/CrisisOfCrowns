__SESSION__
- One of the missing bodies was identified, [[Stag Lord|Ser Leona Blackmont]]
	- No idea how long they've been missing either
	- 8 missing bodies total
	- We sent [[Jack Scratch]] out to scout to see what's going on there
		- 6 silver now, 6 for a finder's fee, and if he finds anything he can take up to 15s. If he finds nothing we probably owe him 15s
- We restock some things
	- We leave a deer at the butcher, it belongs to [[Fyudor]]
- We take off onto the road
	- Our horse is "unnamed": dawg, dog, doug
	- The forest parts for us, as [[Greenbelt]] said; it will be a short trip
- The road is blocked, we see a humanoid figure made out of vines
	- [[Selene]] points it out to us, but there is nothing there :(
	- [[Selene]], religion: It is a favored form of malicious plant spirits, common form taken by fey; did not get any religious feelings, but only her getting this "vision" means it was important
	- [[Novamere]], religion: Man made of tree roots can be a messenger from [[Drasil]], also malicious fey, full-sized man means it probably is not malicious
	- [[Rory]], history: Tale by [[Ser George]]; a man lost an arm in battle and one day returned with a new arm made of vines. Similar things happened in other places
- We talk about strats, and the plant thing reappears but closer
	- The plant thing was [[Novamere]]'s height
	- It probably isn't the fey, given [[Novamere]]'s new history check
- We see a bear, named doorknob
	- [[Selene]] gets attacked by a thorn, something from a creature that's both divine and the old ways. Something that worships the old ways of nature.
	- The bear is scared off by [[Selene]]'s screams of getting attacked, a child with a sword, [[Ghorza]], and a rabid bugbear
- [[Krusa]] got stabbed by [[Novamere]] to fake her injury
	- She's going in to try to convince people to join us
	- "Try not to kill [[Larry (Spearmint)]], he's friendly"
- We fight
	- Someone on a horse comes, it is an undead; turns out to be [[Tom, Local Cannibal]]
		- We murder him
	- Larry, Dairy, Marry are siding with [[Krusa]]
- [[Tom, Local Cannibal]] has a note
	- "Enjoy this second chance. I will not give you a third. If you wish to enjoy it for long, you need to feed." - "S" (single letter)
	- [[Novamere]] and [[Blume]] look for runes on the body
		- They are in infernal, [[Novamere]] copies it down
		- [[Blume]], detect magic, magic's very presence makes his head hurt; the magic that was in him is fading. Necromancy, evocation, and transmutation magic
		- Looking closer, the two of us piece together that whatever [[Tom, Local Cannibal]] was... he isn't now, but he wasn't mindless. He was still tom, but something was altered
- Loot
	- 20 silver, 1 bottle of nice alcohol 20s
	- Some maps, notes between [[Druid Gorbag]] and the [[Stag Lord]]
		- They used animal messengers, messages are just regular mostly, some relate to the recent destruction of camps in the area. The [[Stag Lord]] is "disappointed" by this development
			- "You have lost too much. Too many men, too much money. I am disappointed", signed with an impression in the paper of a horned skull

**Some animals and historic entities / people / things are coming back... Even as gods they don't know why...**

When specific creatures exist on the material plane, just the fact that they are there spurns lesser spirits to act out and multiply (e.g. forests can rapidly grow)... The last time this type of spiritual convergence occurred was before the [[Ghitmos Conflict]] that shattered the two continents 500 years ago. A greater sea spirit was brought to the coast of the continent of Zendahi. A lot of creates of supernatural spirits converged. This spirit was later sealed, but before it could be the content was cracked. It ended the longest ran civilization on the continent over night.

**Researching the [[House Ni'Mallory]]...**

For over 200 years, [[Clan Ni'Mallory]] was a clan of clawfolk who lived not on the mainland but lived on the outlying islands of the Cracked Claw Bay. 150 years ago, [[Clan Ni'Mallory]], lead by [[Sean Ni'Mallory]], moved to given land... They were given land due to a clause in a treaty. A local, now extinct, noble [[House Voldoria]] gave them an [[Oathblade]] of the [[Guard Captain]]... also known as a more common name [[Guide]]. Since then, [[House Ni'Mallory]] has called the [[White Water Rush]] home. It is ruled over by the fortified keep of [[Rapids Run]]. The highest ranking member of the house ever is the still alive [[Eret|Eret Ni'Mallory]]

**Looking up stories and their origins about the [[False Queen]]...

Only started occurring about 1,000 years ago and is *rarely* used. Every few 100 years it pops up for a few years then disappears. No one knows the name of the figure, only the epiphytes of her known: [[False Queen]], Briar Heart, Prime Witch of Ash, Weaver of Mist, Shadow on the Wall

She has appeared in many different places, but there are a lot of primary sources that have put her on [[Ethemore]] more than once. Here-say on whether it is the same spirit, but a lot of similar effects on the appearance of the spirit.

Finds a redacted parchment that refers to a [[False Queen]], a [[Hooded King]], and a [[Drowned Snake]]...

**Asking how to cure [[Drakhook]] from his coma...**

Magical comas like this end 1 of three ways: just ends, magical components missing, death... Unsure what's actually going on though

**[[Cassia]] reading books about druidic and other random magics...**

Gains advantage on survival checks within the area to forge or find rare ingredients... The noble houses has changed, but for the last 500 years after the [[Ghitmos Conflict]], [[Ethemore]] was a multi-kingdom continent. Each region has their own ruler. Royals, great houses, lordly houses, ranked nobles, knightly ranked nobles. About 35 years [[House Norcross]] took over and made it so that they alone are in charge.

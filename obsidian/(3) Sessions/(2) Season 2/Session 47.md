We come back after not playing for a bit!

- We're at the [[Capital City]] of the [[Bitter Water Vale]], a center for trade
	- Giant half-circle of walls extending from the [[Bitter Water Vale]] sea... Sieging this place would be almost impossible...
	- Not everyone is treated well here, there is sewage and litter throughout some of the city
	- The [[Crowned Keep]] is one of the greatest works of modern architecture on the continent 
	- There are 3 hills:
		- On the first of the hills is the largest temple in the city, the entitreity of the temple district on the hill
		- The 2nd district is a ruins / memorial to the ancient kings of the capital.... Long before [[House Norcross]] claimed this land
		- The 3rd has walls of the [[Crowned Keep]] itself, having a standing guard of over 150 and 300/450 living within a 15 minute walk of the keep. The gates could probably be held by as little as 10 people
- [[Zach]]
	- We start with [[Zach]], following signs in [[Thieves Cant]]... Nondescript location, house, etc... This is a front.. He follows a trap door down
		- There are torches on the wall, but only enough to show dim light
		- Signs of travel, going to a hollow... A through-fare of the [[Capital's Underways]]
			- The Marketplace, a commercial district
			- [[Mia's Place]], a brothel (and other shops)
			- Other City Access

			- 3 more signs to different directions...
		- Was spotted in the tunnels by a guy that kept walking and two kids
	- [[Zach]] sees a knight, [[Ser Kenna]] of [[Stone Hedge]] who flashes a pewter coin with a crying sparrow, a symbol of [[Eret]] (?)... They cannot pass the message, but the best time to talk to her would be during the tournament
		- [[Engator]] is in [[Shark Tooth Run District]], by the river of [[Shark Tooth Run]]
		- [[Ivan]] of the [[Golden Hart Inn]] would help him find the person he was contracted to humiliate... [[Mia's Place]] would definitely know information
		- Outside the city in a [[Field of Tents]], many [[Sparrow]] congregate around the nest of stone hedge.
			- The camp section that is for a family ruling over the town of [[Stone Hedge]] has someone that might know something...
	- [[Zach]] makes his way to [[Mia's Place]], walking forever, climbing a large ladder, eventually getting into a closet
		- [[Zach]] makes his way through the brothel, essentially going back stage... He wants to meet [[Mia]] to get information: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cwkej79U3ek
		- He goes to the back, met by guards and staff
		- [[Mia]], a gnome, and an adrodgvnous person
		- "I am here hired from [[House Yllavaris]], [[House Norcross]], and my contact dictates that I will fly as a [[Sparrow]]." - [[Zach]]

	- Your target is a man named [[Alletheaus]], he has a small shop in the [[Market District]] on the street of sorcery... [[Alletheaus' Enchanting Emporium]]
	- [[Zach]] makes a deal with [[Mia]], information for another job...
		- She tosses him a brass coin with a sheet of paper on one side, and on the other has a weeping press... A news group owes [[Mia]] a favor, now they owe [[Zach]] one. Get proof, and the whole town will read it
		- Your target can be found at the [[Mouth of the River Road]] at the city center in the [[Market District]]... His name is [[Lauren Slait]], a herald who has been spreading information that should not be spread. Publicly murder him, crossbow to the throat. Don't be seen, and leave. 
			- If you do this by sundown tonight, the coin will be yours...
				- Shows a sigil, on the front there is a headstone and on the back there is a tower... This coin will get you in the gates of the [[Crowned Keep]] for an audience with [[Garth Houndstone|Lord Commander Ser Garth Houndstone]]... 
			- If you wait, do it by the end of the tournament

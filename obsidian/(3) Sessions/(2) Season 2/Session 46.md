- [[Cassia]] and [[Willa]] are meeting with [[Droeph]]'s brother, [[Rhydahn]] as [[Cassia]] and [[Rea'Thain]] as [[Willa]] ![[side-eye-suspicious.gif|lp right]]
	- [[Cassia]] passes multiple saving throws to keep him out 
	- [[Rhydahn]] finally gets in, and [[Cassia]]'s body rapidly dehydrates and ages 
	- [[Willa]] is bleeding pure shadow from every part of her face
	- Epiphytes used during the conversation, not belonging to anything but just words they can make out: King of Nothing, Ship Eater, Stone Shaper, The Red Lady, The Forgotten One, Bone Lord ([[Rhydahn|Bone Master]]?), Winter's Bite ([[Agrius|Winter's Rasp]]?), Prince of Misers, Mistress of Lies, Forget Me Not, [[Greenbelt|Puppet Master]], Lantern Watcher, Hooded King, and [[False Queen]].... 
	- Insight from the conversation: Some animals and historic entities / people / things are coming back... Even as gods they don't know why...
	- They awaken at a table, with a chunk of flawlessly cut black opal (1gp worth, for [[Captive Spirit]])... 
		- [[Cassia]] gets a new spell [[Unnatural Endurance]], always prepared and does not count against prepared spells
- [[Rory]] finishes a conversation from last session with [[Bethany Irons]] ![[sad_cat.gif|lp right]]
	- She meets [[Lukas]]...
		- [L]: "You look like me... but... tall..."
		- [R]: "I like your hair, it looks like my hair"
		- [L]: "Do I know you?"
		- [R]: "My name is Aurora, but you can call me Rory"
		- They talk about some things, getting to know each other
		- [R]: "Your brother is my brother too..."
		- [L]: "I got to meet a red haired lady a few years ago. [[Bethany Irons|Bethany]] called her Auntie Aron, but I knew... [[Dorin]] told me."
		- [R]: "Can I tell you a secret? I want to be with mom too... I went on multiple trips with [[Ser George|George]], got to see the whole world and met little kids like you... But I didn't have a roof, a warm place, or someone to make me medicine when I was sick... It was very scary."
		- [L]: "I wanted to go (to the [[Capital City]]) with [[Dorin]]. He told me a story about Dad and [[Ser George|George]]... That's what [[Dorin]] wants to do, and I wanted to be his squire. He told me no."
		- [R]: "I've seen little boys like you thrown in fire, lose arms... I found out today that I had a lot more family than I thought I had. I would be very sad to lose that again. I want you to be happier and healthier than I was at your age."
		- [L]: "[[Bethany Irons|Bethany]] says home isn't a place, it's a place where people want you to be there. Does that mean I'm home?"
		- [R]: "I can't take you with me... I don't even know what the next time I'll see you again is... But we have right now. So, what would you like to do?"
		- [L]: "When [[Dorin]] would train, he would train me too..."
		- They train a bit and [[Rory]] gives him a dagger...
		- [L]: "I miss [[Dorin]]... Now I'm going to miss you too"
		- [R]: "I missed you before I even knew you.... When I go see mom, I'm going to grab her by the ear and yell at her for not coming to see you."
- We take off on the road!
- [[Zach]], [[Cassia]], and [[Blume]] search for some plants to help enhance his kit. Like

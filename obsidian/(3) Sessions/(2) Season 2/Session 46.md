< Can I tell you a secret? I want to be with mom too... I went on multiple trips with [[Ser George|George]], got to see the whole world and met little kids like you... But I didn't have a roof, a warm place, or someone to make me medicine when I was sick... It was very scary.

< I've seen little boys like you thrown in fire, lose arms, or worse... I found out today that I had a lot more family than I thought I had. I would be very sad to lose that again. I want you to be happier and healthier than I was at your age.

< I can't take you with me... I don't even know what the next time I'll see you again is... But we have right now. So, what would you like to do?

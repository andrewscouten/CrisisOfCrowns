<br>Dreaming

<br>No longer in a tavern; shadow/misty [grove], crash of waves off in the distance
<br>The mist and leaves don't shake or move, frozen
<br>Around him, he sees sign of death and violence; weapons, armor, bodies, some fresh some long rotten.  
<br>In front of him, [a broken statue]
<br>This statue is a shrine that has fallen into disrepair long ago in front of him.

<br>He feels regret, sadness, and grief


<br>He feels the wind around him push him forward (15-20ft). He trips over a Morningstar embedded in the chest of a skeleton
<br>He looks back, the shrine is repaired

<br>Pieces of rock create an arm, and he hears "Cheer up, the worst is yet to come"




<br>He awakens

<br>Dreaming

<br>She hears noises of her home
<br>Sees [her encampment, sprawled across a long valley on a hill]; beyond that she sees nothing
<br>She stands up, reaches for her axe that's not there; no people, the village is abandoned as if it was left minutes ago
<br>Hears a snarl behind her. She now has an axe in her hand. She turns and sees a shadow like form of a humanoid

<br>He was wearing spiked armor




<br>She awakens.

<br>Large owl-bear with a curse
<br>She is a daughter of the mother of bears <a data-href="Ur-Mother Bear" href="https://halkscout.github.io/Ethemore/(2)-campaign/entities/ancients/ur-mother-bear.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Ur-Mother Bear</a>

<br><br>
<br>Her and her siblings were tasked with guarding sacred locations; in return her mother's people would be left to thrive
<br>She has guarded the temple every day, for a very very long time
<br><br>
<br>Took a rest and woke up one day and had branches growing out of her spine
<br>Initial Description

<br>As the bear approaches, we see it is covered in wounds, branches &amp; thorns. Some of the branches are coming back out of it and growing back into it


<br>The thing growing in her is hunting for energy. It reacts to radiant energy with growing into whatever it can get its branches into
<br>Someone in the past had tried to remove this curse with no change
<br>[Detect magic] reveals that it is similar to an occultist spell, but not one that <a data-href="Blume" href="https://halkscout.github.io/Ethemore/(1)-the-party/blume.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Blume</a> recognizes

<br>Some of the brambles are surface level, some are deep inside of her

<br>Counts as celestial and undead magic
<br>Counts as desecrated


<br>[Few can wield such curses]

<br>The large cathedral is carved into a cliff-face
<br>The temple was built upon a new temple, upon a new temple, upon a new temple, etc. 
<br>APPEARANCE<br>
<br>The temple is beautiful, with lush trees and grass growing. The trees have roots that have bodies entwined in with them.
<br>Sunlight appears to be coming from above, despite stone overhead
<br>The walls have painted murals of myths and tales

<br>Images of <a data-href="Green Knight" href="https://halkscout.github.io/Ethemore/Green Knight" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Green Knight</a>, with a sword in the ground and plants extend out of it
<br>A man in green and a woman in brown with small blue orbs in between then
<br>Large man with head of a wolf howling at a moon that is glowing green rather than white


<br>The temple is old, with some older stone seating
<br>Towards the back there is a large statue of a man in archaic plate armor. 

<br>All we can see that is not worn to time is a large smile and eyes. 
<br>One temple of his forehead has a tree branch growing, and the other has an antler

<br>"Not yet my child, you are not ready. Your persistence will bloom"

<br>

<br>"Stay out of this man, you shall not claim him"

<br>"You are a fool, I already have"

<br>"What you have can be easily stripped away. You are nothing in our eyes, and you shall take nothing"

<br>She stands up, reaches for her axe that's not there; no people, the village is abandoned as if it was left minutes ago
<br>Hears a snarl behind her. She now has an axe in her hand. She turns and sees a shadow like form of a humanoid

<br>No longer in a tavern; shadow/misty [grove], crash of waves off in the distance
<br>The mist and leaves don't shake or move, frozen
<br>Around him, he sees sign of death and violence; weapons, armor, bodies, some fresh some long rotten.  
<br>In front of him, [a broken statue]
<br>This statue is a shrine that has fallen into disrepair long ago in front of him.

<br>He feels regret, sadness, and grief


<br>He feels the wind around him push him forward (15-20ft). He trips over a Morningstar embedded in the chest of a skeleton
<br>He looks back, the shrine is repaired

<br>Pieces of rock create an arm, and he hears "Cheer up, the worst is yet to come"

 <br>SUMMARY<br>
<br>
<br>SESSION<br>
<br>We wake up, the dragon fey took <a data-href="Ghorza" href="https://halkscout.github.io/Ethemore/(1)-the-party/ghorza.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Ghorza</a> and <a data-href="Fyudor" href="https://halkscout.github.io/Ethemore/(1)-the-party/fyudor.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Fyudor</a>
<br>We see dog tracks that morph into 3 separate types of tracks; 2 human, one dog

<br>Dog tracks go into brush, one set goes into woods, one set goes to <a data-href="Lady Thissleblack" href="https://halkscout.github.io/Ethemore/(2)-campaign/people/lady-thissleblack.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Lady Thissleblack</a>'s house


<br>As we approach <a data-href="Lady Thissleblack" href="https://halkscout.github.io/Ethemore/(2)-campaign/people/lady-thissleblack.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Lady Thissleblack</a>'s house on the tracks, we start to see signs of old magic

<br>Her house is heavily fortified with wards
<br>We see wards above the house and spend some time investigating

<br>There is a cloven hoof on the door, that appeared by magical means to be a deer print until it was investigated
<br><a data-href="Selene" href="https://halkscout.github.io/Ethemore/(1)-the-party/_reserve/selene.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Selene</a> looks for valuables....
<br><a data-href="Blume" href="https://halkscout.github.io/Ethemore/(1)-the-party/blume.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Blume</a> finds a journal

<br>Fragment of a very old recipe book
<br>[LEARNED THE RECIPE FOR THE BASIC HEALING POTION AND ALCHEMIST FIRE]


<br><a data-href="Novamere" href="https://halkscout.github.io/Ethemore/(1)-the-party/_reserve/novamere.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Novamere</a> sees some runes written in the kitchen, written in <a data-href="Dwarvish" href="https://halkscout.github.io/Ethemore/(2)-campaign/languages/dwarvish.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Dwarvish</a>




<br>We see tracks that lead into the house from the back door, and leaving the front door into the woods

<br>We follow the tracks into the woods, they are about 3-5 days out
<br>There are a lot of tracks in the area, the path is frequently used
<br>We are entering a wild part of the woods, with a lot of different tracks / creatures


<br>We eventually come across a small cave

<br>This cave is bad. Cave smells like shit, iron, and smoke
<br>Cervitaurs in the cave D: 

<br>Lower body of doe / buck, upper body is a woman
<br>They are centaurs warped by the fey magic




<br>There are a ton of traps in this cave, they have feral goblins they are using for warfare and traps.
<br>Selene goes down deeper into the cave, sees two goblins talking to one another

<br>One goblin has a necklace of dog-ears


<br>We had a very long and hard fight, <a data-href="Selene" href="https://halkscout.github.io/Ethemore/(1)-the-party/_reserve/selene.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Selene</a> went down
<br>We discover a ritual area, there is a severed hand on a ritual table further in where we could not get without combat

<br>We see a large bed in the center of a room
<br>There is another severed hand on the Cervitaur
<br><a data-href="Novamere" href="https://halkscout.github.io/Ethemore/(1)-the-party/_reserve/novamere.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Novamere</a>'s religion: this is an unholy place, it is best to not remain here for long
<br>[We copy down some runes in abyssal/infernal that were on the wall]
<br>Skull of goblin on alter
<br>Tucked into a corner is a shard that looks like black glass


<br><a data-href="Selene" href="https://halkscout.github.io/Ethemore/(1)-the-party/_reserve/selene.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Selene</a> almost dies to traps while looting D:

<br>With the ritual, they were reaching out to some form of demon

<br>They are the cult of blood, they were probably reaching out to a demon to bind it to serve their cult... We don't know if they succeeded or not, or what demon they were trying to contact


<br>We make it back to <a data-href="Lady Thissleblack" href="https://halkscout.github.io/Ethemore/(2)-campaign/people/lady-thissleblack.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Lady Thissleblack</a>'s house, she casts a spell with several components

<br>A lot of the radishes we gathered
<br>She created a potion for <a data-href="Novamere" href="https://halkscout.github.io/Ethemore/(1)-the-party/_reserve/novamere.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Novamere</a>, which cures him of a disease he got during combat from a fungal goblin that exploded (It would have made him die, or burn in the sun)


<br>She takes <a data-href="Blume" href="https://halkscout.github.io/Ethemore/(1)-the-party/blume.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Blume</a> and <a data-href="Rory" href="https://halkscout.github.io/Ethemore/(1)-the-party/rory.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Rory</a> out of the house, about 5 minutes out

<br>We stare into water, a <a data-href="Bloodwell Pit" href="https://halkscout.github.io/Ethemore/(2)-campaign/misc/old-faith/bloodwell-pit.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Bloodwell Pit</a>

<br>A sacred location to those who follow the old ways
<br>Religious ceremonies can be held here
<br>"There are rites that can be observed on nights such like tonight"

<br>Of the 3 moons, the red one is in a new moon; the smallest moon is half full; the broken moon shows many facets of a new moon
<br>Magic waxes and wains, days like tonight are good for rituals

<br>Taken back to a memory of a dying lady giving her the sword.. She remembers a word

<br>"Bright"


<br>She pulls the sword out, and it feels lighter (no repairs) and easier to use


<br>LOOT:<br>
<br>Decanter that makes water always taste good (does not purify it)
<br>We find a curved dagger; dagger is not magical but there are traces of magic on it as if someone casted spells with it previously (RITUAL DAGGER)
<br>Necklace made of human teeth

 <br>SUMMARY<br>
<br>
<br>SESSION<br>
<br>We are hanging around <a data-href="Lady Thissleblack" href="https://halkscout.github.io/Ethemore/(2)-campaign/people/lady-thissleblack.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Lady Thissleblack</a>'s house

<br>We see some notes written not by her on the wall

<br>"<a data-href="Greenbelt" href="https://halkscout.github.io/Ethemore/(2)-campaign/entities/greenbelt.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Greenbelt</a> we have taken the lady, hurry up and meet us there"

<br>Cut to <a data-href="Fyudor" href="https://halkscout.github.io/Ethemore/(1)-the-party/fyudor.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Fyudor</a> and <a data-href="Ghorza" href="https://halkscout.github.io/Ethemore/(1)-the-party/ghorza.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Ghorza</a>

<br>They need to scare something away, not kill it

<br>"They are they way, goodbye"


<br>They find the kobald

<br>Kobold: "Why are you here"
<br><a data-href="Ghorza" href="https://halkscout.github.io/Ethemore/(1)-the-party/ghorza.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Ghorza</a>: "... Why are you here?"

<br>Why is Gamora


<br>The kobald has thumbs, and lives there. The evil <a data-href="Ghorza" href="https://halkscout.github.io/Ethemore/(1)-the-party/ghorza.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Ghorza</a> and <a data-href="Fyudor" href="https://halkscout.github.io/Ethemore/(1)-the-party/fyudor.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Fyudor</a> are there to evict him


<br>They evict the poor man for not playing property tax
<br>They get a map of the area we're in as a reward


<br>There's a knock at the door, and we see <a data-href="Ghorza" href="https://halkscout.github.io/Ethemore/(1)-the-party/ghorza.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Ghorza</a> and <a data-href="Fyudor" href="https://halkscout.github.io/Ethemore/(1)-the-party/fyudor.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Fyudor</a>!

<br>They give the map to <a data-href="Rory" href="https://halkscout.github.io/Ethemore/(1)-the-party/rory.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Rory</a> and <a data-href="Novamere" href="https://halkscout.github.io/Ethemore/(1)-the-party/_reserve/novamere.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Novamere</a> to decipher

<br>They see a few small clearings on the map about a few days from each other
<br>One location is the radish patch we were in previously
<br>Other 2 are unknown
<br>On the back of the map: "Some hidden locations, once lost. You find now. - G"




<br><a data-href="Lady Thissleblack" href="https://halkscout.github.io/Ethemore/(2)-campaign/people/lady-thissleblack.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Lady Thissleblack</a> will be back into town before us probably, and will tell them of our deeds
<br>The party of 2 missing guards is probably dead
<br><a data-href="Novamere" href="https://halkscout.github.io/Ethemore/(1)-the-party/_reserve/novamere.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Novamere</a> is probably traumatized by this ordeal of him needing a cure :) 
<br>We talk to <a data-href="Lady Thissleblack" href="https://halkscout.github.io/Ethemore/(2)-campaign/people/lady-thissleblack.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Lady Thissleblack</a> about the [Bodies missing in graveyard] (<a data-href="Objectives" href="https://halkscout.github.io/Ethemore/(3)-sessions/(1)-autumn/objectives.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Objectives</a>)

<br>Some people about a week away, straight north, newcomers [one is probably a necromancer] &lt;- missing bodies sound like a recipe for something they would want

<br>In the <a data-href="North Wood" href="https://halkscout.github.io/Ethemore/(0)-obsidian_stuff/_uncategorized/north-wood.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">North Wood</a>, they are 3-4 days away now probably! We should stop by the town first


<br>Sometimes woods witches take bodies (she doesn't know of anyone else, and she didn't do it)
<br>Goblin camp is further away then the necromancer (more north)
<br><a data-href="Rory" href="https://halkscout.github.io/Ethemore/(1)-the-party/rory.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Rory</a> is called Auora?

<br>Dead husk of a tree that is long dead
<br><a data-href="Rory" href="https://halkscout.github.io/Ethemore/(1)-the-party/rory.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Rory</a> does not know our ways yet
<br>Soft floating light is glowing away inside the tree, whistles of wind
<br>Soft mulch ground, tree trunk is as wide as a table
<br>Light settles on <a data-href="Rory" href="https://halkscout.github.io/Ethemore/(1)-the-party/rory.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Rory</a>'s arm, feels different than a wisp in the woods; feels comforting
<br>"We are those that are, and those that have been for a very long time. You have been blessed by us, let's see if you are worthy."

<br>"I promise you I'm not"






<br>We sneak attacked a group of bandits

<br>Killed them, there are 3 known locations that our prisoner knows of
<br>There's one close, south-ish

<br>"Who is the leader of the camp?"

<br>She can be identified by her weapon, same quality of Gorza's axe, hand-axe probably
<br>She has 5 of them


<br>We were on our way to this camp????
<br>It used to be a trading post

<br>Taken over by blue tatzelwurms




<br>Leader of the bandits at large, not just this camp

<br>The have a stag head
<br>The leader, <a data-href="Stag Lord" href="https://halkscout.github.io/Ethemore/(2)-campaign/entities/stag-lord.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Stag Lord</a>, also calls himself

<br>[Lord of all the hills in the wood]
<br>[Master of the horned fort] &lt;- never heard of this place
<br>[First of the freemen] &lt;- "First of the bandits" / "King of the bandits" essentially


<br>He is getting bandits in the region under his control. He has some as far as a month's travel away
<br>His control down south is unknown, but in this area every bandit calls him lord
<br>He is a drunk, doesn't usually leave his fort
<br>Maybe not a member of the cult of blood yet, but his generals are


<br>There were other towns attacked

 <br>SESSION<br>
<br>We kill the bandits
<br>In the main enemy's tent

<br>She has the stag leader's symbol embroidered onto her tent &amp; her armor
<br>There was a letter nailed to the ceiling
<br>Fragment of a map
<br>We find some loot


<br>We get some information from her (<a data-href="Krusa" href="https://halkscout.github.io/Ethemore/(2)-campaign/people/krusa.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Krusa</a>)

<br>The <a data-href="Stag Lord" href="https://halkscout.github.io/Ethemore/(2)-campaign/entities/stag-lord.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Stag Lord</a> has been on a downward spiral recently ever since he came in contact with some <a data-href="Weird Cultists" href="https://halkscout.github.io/Ethemore/Weird Cultists" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Weird Cultists</a>

<br>He hasn't left his office or trained new recruits in awhile, his personality has changed
<br>He has gotten a taste for alcohol


<br>Main fort where the <a data-href="Stag Lord" href="https://halkscout.github.io/Ethemore/(2)-campaign/entities/stag-lord.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Stag Lord</a> is located is about 2 and a half weeks on foot to the south-west (closer to the cold)

<br>Couple days away to the north, old Tom

<br>He is now working for them
<br>He is also working with the <a data-href="Druid Gorbag" href="https://halkscout.github.io/Ethemore/(0)-obsidian_stuff/_uncategorized/druid-gorbag.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Druid Gorbag</a>

<br>1.5 day east to <a data-href="Druid Gorbag" href="https://halkscout.github.io/Ethemore/(0)-obsidian_stuff/_uncategorized/druid-gorbag.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Druid Gorbag</a> from where we are
<br>2.5 days west is a goblin camp <a data-href="Dog Skinners" href="https://halkscout.github.io/Ethemore/(0)-obsidian_stuff/_uncategorized/dog-skinners.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Dog Skinners</a>

<br>One of the camps raided <a data-href="Kaerliv" href="https://halkscout.github.io/Ethemore/(2)-campaign/locations/cities/kaerliv.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Kaerliv</a>




<br>She has a bounty on her head (150s, has multiple bounties)
<br>Everyone that goes against the <a data-href="Stag Lord" href="https://halkscout.github.io/Ethemore/(2)-campaign/entities/stag-lord.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Stag Lord</a> dies mysteriously 


<br>She'll help us fight <a data-href="Druid Gorbag" href="https://halkscout.github.io/Ethemore/(0)-obsidian_stuff/_uncategorized/druid-gorbag.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Druid Gorbag</a>'s fort, if we help her get her bounty off of her head
<br>We take the next few days to go back to <a data-href="Kaerliv" href="https://halkscout.github.io/Ethemore/(2)-campaign/locations/cities/kaerliv.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Kaerliv</a>

<br>Binding our prisoners, the 2 bandits and bandit leader


<br>Dreams

<br><a data-href="Fyudor" href="https://halkscout.github.io/Ethemore/(1)-the-party/fyudor.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Fyudor</a>, awakens to something scratching on the inside of their chest

<br>The feeling spreads to the whole chest, the itch growing to pain to agony
<br>Blood drips from his mouth


<br><a data-href="Blume" href="https://halkscout.github.io/Ethemore/(1)-the-party/blume.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Blume</a>

<br>Seeing flashes of color, watching a scene that's moving really fast that he only sees blurs
<br>Hear the same deeper voice from his first dream; rock falls, waves, trees
<br>"Grow. We've got our eye on you for a reason. Grow young Blume. Let us see how the garden looks."
<br>The images now go in reverse, as if falling; awaken with sap on her tongue


<br><a data-href="Rory" href="https://halkscout.github.io/Ethemore/(1)-the-party/rory.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Rory</a>

<br>She wakes up to a sight where <a data-href="Lady Thissleblack" href="https://halkscout.github.io/Ethemore/(2)-campaign/people/lady-thissleblack.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Lady Thissleblack</a> took her
<br>She sees a few hot springs, and between them there's a stone
<br>Intricate symbols on the stone, and a crack splitting it in half
<br>A small hole is there, the size of the sword, as if someone once broke the stone with the sword

<br>She tries to put the sword back in, there is some resistance
<br>"(Laughter) Interesting..."




<br><a data-href="Novamere" href="https://halkscout.github.io/Ethemore/(1)-the-party/_reserve/novamere.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Novamere</a>

<br>Soup / medicine time




<br>We see 3 green trolls, fighting each other

<br>We ignore them, terrifying


<br>We see an ambush setup, and we avoid it
<br>We see more bandits on the road, and convince them to join to us

<br>Dragon Fey, <a data-href="Greenbelt" href="https://halkscout.github.io/Ethemore/(2)-campaign/entities/greenbelt.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Greenbelt</a>

<br>Takes some of our things as tribute
<br>He thanks us

<br>Vomits up a large axe for gorza
<br>Eats her old axe


<br>He will tell the citizens to leave us alone
<br>If we go hunting we will find food; searching we might find what we are looking for

<br>"If we take too much, I will take back. Use this gift with integrity, but we will have a problem if you take too much."
<br>Blume has already given back. His blood is in their water.




<br>We went back to town

<br>Everyone was put into irons but <a data-href="Krusa" href="https://halkscout.github.io/Ethemore/(2)-campaign/people/krusa.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Krusa</a>

 <br>SESSION<br>
<br>We stopped last time with the party splitting to do tasks around town

<br>They exchange hellos, the town needs a lot of help
<br>In the temple, she will spend time with her gods

<br>She feels a light breeze on the wind, a positive omen




<br>TODO: Get armor, survival gear, weapons, refill arrows, melt down crappy bandit knives


<br><a data-href="Blume" href="https://halkscout.github.io/Ethemore/(1)-the-party/blume.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Blume</a>

<br>When she leaves town she will also leave some things behind for it
<br>She gives Blume the beginner <a data-href="Undercommon" href="https://halkscout.github.io/Ethemore/(2)-campaign/languages/undercommon.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Undercommon</a> course in 5 minutes (Please, Hello, Thank you)
<br>They take time together to do some magic together, and make potions and stuff for the town
<br>She helps him draw protection sigils on his skin




<br><a data-href="Ghorza" href="https://halkscout.github.io/Ethemore/(1)-the-party/ghorza.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Ghorza</a>

<br>She takes a survey of the town

<br>The town is looking well, everyone has a home and people are recovering
<br>A few more corpses have also gone missing
<br>New people have not been coming since the attack
<br>The number of random bandit attacks in the area has decreased


<br>She asks about the orphanage

<br>Most of the older kids have left their old life to train with the guards

<br>We hired bandits to stop being bandits, to fight bandits, to stop banditry

They just look bad royal-ily

<br>We have been given authority to raise a group of men-at-arms

<br>We are each allowed to have 4 people individually; this makes 30 total including us
<br>We will need to come up with a group name, as we are now under the Salrus name

<br>We went with <a data-href="The Unnamed" href="https://halkscout.github.io/Ethemore/The Unnamed" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">The Unnamed</a>, very clever


<br>For the first 2 months, we need to have her or <a data-href="Lady Thissleblack" href="https://halkscout.github.io/Ethemore/(2)-campaign/people/lady-thissleblack.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Lady Thissleblack</a>'s approval before our men-at-arms can get hired by someone else other than <a data-href="House Salrus" href="https://halkscout.github.io/Ethemore/(2)-campaign/factions/royals/house-salrus.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">House Salrus</a>

<br>Some other bodies have gone missing, some on the road, some in other places

<br>3 very old skeletons
<br>2 of unknown decomposition age
<br>All unrelated except one couple


<br>Andrew kinda checked out, doing this instead of paying attention. Oops...

<br>Possible group names

<br>To be sassy:

<br>Make a insights, religious (wis), and a constitution save; fear 

<br>He does pretty good on rolls


<br>For a brief moment he smells salt and iron, and as he focuses on that he is brought back to the scene of his dream (remembering, not there anew)

<br>As he looks around, the smell of salt and iron is stronger than it was before, then it fades completely
<br>He feels almost rested despite being active (almost dying, traveling) for so long




<br><a data-href="Blume" href="https://halkscout.github.io/Ethemore/(1)-the-party/blume.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Blume</a> reads more undercommon, he can recognize the alphabet but not words.

<br>We can go to Fern's place in town to restock on rations; will trade a fair price
<br>We can drop off stuff we don't want to carry with us in her cellar; she has the key


<br>Selling ??????????

<br>Assorted weapons, low quality (13 pounds worth of daggers, spears, short swords)

<br>30s worth of materials

<br>6 silver now, 6 for a finder's fee, and if he finds anything he can take up to 15s. If he finds nothing we probably owe him 15s




<br>We restock some things

<br>We leave a deer at the butcher, it belongs to <a data-href="Fyudor" href="https://halkscout.github.io/Ethemore/(1)-the-party/fyudor.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Fyudor</a>

<br>Inside is a ring... She puts it on without checking with anyone who knows magic D: 

<br>May her gods protect her
<br>They kinda did? The ring feels like divine magic in some way, but different than her divine magic.

<br>We left off just getting back to the town

<br>She can't really identify it, as it could be many people. Here are the ones she can think of that have been exiled:

<br>Her "bastard cousin"
<br>2 of her father's siblings and 1 cousin left under bad circumstances
<br>4th son of the current king of our hold?
<br>There is a teacher that taught everyone how to write, he is still alive

<br>He is in prison, and lost a hand for attempted thievery against a noble family

<br>She wants to give us some [2x Animal Messenger] scrolls.
<br>She tells us about some rumors:

<br>A road leading into the Pendrick Hills has shown signs of use despite being out of commission for around 50 years
<br>A lot of noise coming from the abandoned town to the west, fires, clanks, bellows
<br>Heard from <a data-href="Greenbelt" href="https://halkscout.github.io/Ethemore/(2)-campaign/entities/greenbelt.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Greenbelt</a>, a very large creature has taken up residence in a temple near town.

<br>We see some eyes around the perimeter of the necromancer's camp / area

<br>Blume does not recognize this curse as old magic
<br>Selene does not see anything physically wrong with him, or any ritualized scaring
<br>His growing distance between the town and the necromancer's area is causing him to grow weak. Exhaustion will end up killing him if something is not done.
<br>"Novamere gets crop dusted by his god" - Marlo. 

<br>"... We can fix this" he hears to his side
<br>Holy water will remove the curse from within him, as the curse was forced down his throat
<br>Novamere has an awakening?


<br>Novamere prays to his god in desperation, his god creates holy water from his flask
<br>He feeds it to Jack and it helps heal him of some of the curse

<br>He was unable to sleep previously, but now he can. One of his eyes returns to normal, but one is still showing signs of a curse




<br>We arrive at town after long discussion
<br>Novamere buys &amp; makes ingredients for more holy water
<br>Blume determines the curse is not of the old ways, arcane, or Druidic magic
<br>We all buy / barter for some winter gear, some people look fancier than others

<br>The 4 of us here have a feeling of pulling in our stomach. We blink and are no longer in town

<br>It was a mutated bear since last of our knowing; 2 -&gt; 7 on the mutation scale


<br>Greenbelt says we can take anything that doesn't belong in the temple, and it will probably pay us after the job is completed

<br>Don't take things that are used in the temple, like the walls, or candles, etc.


<br>Greenbelt gave us potions for spell slots back, but <a data-href="Novamere" href="https://halkscout.github.io/Ethemore/(1)-the-party/_reserve/novamere.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Novamere</a> and <a data-href="Blume" href="https://halkscout.github.io/Ethemore/(1)-the-party/blume.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Blume</a> now owe it another favor (they are the only one who got the potions, and they drank them right away)
<br>Other threats

<br>Trees that have human faces embedded into them, merging with the bark. They are not welcoming to visitors




<br>We make our way to the temple, where we start to hear and see signs of the bear

<br>As the bear approaches, we see it is covered in wounds, branches &amp; thorns. Some of the branches are coming back out of it and growing back into it
<br>We are fighting the bear

<br><a data-href="Blume" href="https://halkscout.github.io/Ethemore/(1)-the-party/blume.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Blume</a> does a nature check, rolls bad, but these types of mutations are caused by proximity to gates to different plains of existence such as the fey wild. This could be the cause of the mutation?

<br>Mutations like this occur in extended presence of untethered magic


<br><a data-href="Rory" href="https://halkscout.github.io/Ethemore/(1)-the-party/rory.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Rory</a> checks to see if it's attacking because it's in pain or just because it's the way it is.

<br>"It's [The Brown One]'s turn" - Aiden
<br>Blume goes down and gets passed a note

<br>One of those will help us discover information we are looking for

<br>One transforms into a small pearl with a hole in it

<br>In the bag is super fine, almost glimmering ash. Smells of sliver and smells heavily of salt

<br>It would probably kill any necromantic creature that consumes it
<br>Catch his throw up in a metal container so it doesn't go into the earth
<br>DO NOT LET IT TOUCH YOUR SKIN, OR IT WILL EAT YOUR SKIN ALIVE?????????
<br>Disposing of it works like creating holy water, or just a fuck ton of salt




<br>She gives Selene a small beautiful piece of artwork that shows a bear.

<br>It is used to assist and heal the holder, it's small and could be worn by the holder
<br>Requires attunement


<br>She gives Blume a very small leather bound book. They are notes of a very very dear and very very dead friend 

<br>Cover has the words "<a data-href="The Rites of the Green Kings, and the Queen Consorts of Moonlight" href="https://halkscout.github.io/Ethemore/(3)-sessions/(0)-loot/(2)-important-items/the-rites-of-the-green-kings,-and-the-queen-consorts-of-moonlight.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">The Rites of the Green Kings, and the Queen Consorts of Moonlight</a>"


<br>Her and Rory have a forehead mind-meld for a moment, as she gives Rory her thanks

<br>They walk to a pool that is similar to a <a data-href="Bloodwell Pit" href="https://halkscout.github.io/Ethemore/(2)-campaign/misc/old-faith/bloodwell-pit.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Bloodwell Pit</a>, and Rory is told to dip the sword into the pool of water
<br>As she dips the sword in, the whole temple becomes illuminated. As she pulls the sword out, it is larger and less scarred. It's not quite a full longsword, but it is an arming sword now

<br>1d8 damage, one handed


<br>"So I was right.... Interesting.... Your Eldritch blast smelt of water, so I thought this would be a good idea to try"
<br>Her best bet to find more information is to seek out <a data-href="The Ruins of the Passed Kings of Wood and Water" href="https://halkscout.github.io/Ethemore/(2)-campaign/locations/poi/the-ruins-of-the-passed-kings-of-wood-and-water.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">The Ruins of the Passed Kings of Wood and Water</a> (<a data-href="Passed Kings of Wood and Water" href="https://halkscout.github.io/Ethemore/Passed Kings of Wood and Water" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Passed Kings of Wood and Water</a>)

<br>"From water it came, water you gave. Don't be afraid to do that again. May it one day show you its full glory. On that day, or after, I would love to see you again in these halls once more."




<br>Selene asks about her dreams but gets no clear answers

<br>She wears one of the father's rings
<br>All 3 of the gods selene works with are speaking to the current events through her ring, which by this point is covered in frost


<br>Those present level up!

<br><a data-href="Ghorza" href="https://halkscout.github.io/Ethemore/(1)-the-party/ghorza.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Ghorza</a>

<br>Back home where she learned how to ride a horse. There are green fields, with a village. She hears something: "Sometimes to protect something you have to let it go."
<br>The village shifts to ruins, she hears a snarl like before. She sees something, its form shifting into various monsters. It has a peer of Gorza's in its grasp. No matter the shifting form, one of her bold brothers is in its grip. She has an axe in hand and swings at its head, avoiding her fellow. The swing goes through the beast, and it does not notice. She reaches out, grabbing her friend. They say "You can save us...". The dream fades


<br><a data-href="Fyudor" href="https://halkscout.github.io/Ethemore/(1)-the-party/fyudor.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Fyudor</a>

<br>They collapse in bed, fall asleep, then awaken. They look out the window, and one of the moons tonight is full. They feel scratching that slowly moves up their arm, across their chest, right under their sternum. They feel the same scratch they felt before. It fades slightly with time. As you breathe in, your lungs hurt as if breathing air that is far too cold. As you breathe out, a cloud of fog crystals. The scratching returns, only worse... and worse. As you look to the moon once more, you hear an echoing snarl like one you've heard many times in the woods. You wake up, scratching... 
<br><a data-href="Fyudor" href="https://halkscout.github.io/Ethemore/(1)-the-party/fyudor.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Fyudor</a> is bleeding from the mouth and both of his hands, where he has clawed into his chest

<br>Remembering the sword, but they are not themselves. As if they are seeing through the eyes of someone else. In their hand is the same sword, still broken and as they last left it. They see it being swung, cleaving through shadow, demons, and people alike. There are no recognizable symbols besides one with [3 pine trees with a crown emblazoned above them (kings of Reventree)], it all being ancient in origin. This could have happened maybe a thousand years ago.

<br>11 people in the caves, probably more... The people that go into the caves do not come back

<br>In the main tent where the Lieutenant leader was

<br>There are 4 desks, one of which is REALLY nice
<br>The more worse desks have some writing

<br>A journal in Orcish (Korvig, Centurean, the hobgoblin)

<br>6 months ago, approached by a woman in black armor requesting assistance between the two groups; the bloody hand
<br>A bit after: <a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="Stag Lord" data-href="Stag Lord" href="https://halkscout.github.io/Ethemore/(2)-campaign/entities/stag-lord.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Ser Leona Blackmont</a> returned, she agreed to introduce us to the Freemen.. It seems we have more allies
<br>2 weeks after: By the orders of our commander we have allied with the Freemen and the Bloody Hand.. We have legitimacy. Soon, we will take back this land with our allies
<br>Trade deal moving "cargo" up the mountain pass for the bloody hand and trading for better quality weapons with Freemen

<br>The people are cargo?


<br>About 2-3 months after: We are to send troops to aid the bloody hand and the freemen taking the town of <a data-href="Kaerliv" href="https://halkscout.github.io/Ethemore/(2)-campaign/locations/cities/kaerliv.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Kaerliv</a>; It will allow us a base of operations... The commander does not trust them so we will send fodder.
<br>The attack failed...
<br>A week ago from present day: New agreements with our allies, we are to capture as many travelers alive as we can. They need workers and bodies... At the moment, the bloody hand has decided to send a representative


<br>Small hidden compartment with a [Spell Scroll] that he does not recognized


<br>Investigating the final nice desk

<br>Found a lot of things <a data-href="Blume" href="https://halkscout.github.io/Ethemore/(1)-the-party/blume.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Blume</a> can't read
<br>"Thank you for this improvement of our alliance. We are quite happy to repay you in kind." - Signed 5 bloody finger prints




<br>The team comes together to guard and reinforce the quarry
<br>What we know:

<br>1 captain in camp, 1 in cave, 2 elsewhere
<br>Orders to strip things for parts, bring them here, bandit stuff
<br>Kuhgai, the bugbear captain: Capture everyone you find alive... 
<br>Rolb, the already dead goblin: Don't bring up the town to the woman in armor... She doesn't take it well... Also don't mention her arm


<br>We take a short rest

<br>1 is in goblin that he cannot read; "Keep the cultists out of it."
<br>In common "New cargo incoming, we will be there at first light" - Kigai


<br>We prepare an ambush and defenses 
<br>We kill everyone, even the ones fleeing (except one goblin)
<br>LOOT<br>
<br>20 sp ring, 5 sp amber ring looted by <a data-href="Blume" href="https://halkscout.github.io/Ethemore/(1)-the-party/blume.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Blume</a>
<br>Found another [Spell Scroll], a ritual that is designed to enact a permeant form of magic weapon... Requires materials that we do not have: 100 silver worth of powdered iron along with 50 silver worth of a magical metal of your choice; can make the weapon +1 magical

Blume gives a person a scroll of animal messenger

<br>We explore a cave, find a very scary statue with sacrifices and blood everywhere


<br>
We fight the leader in the cave

<br>
We try to decipher who the statue is dedicated to

<br>Only one major divinity, if a major divinity is involved
<br><a data-href="Figar" href="https://halkscout.github.io/Ethemore/Figar" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Figar</a>, god of slaughter, power, and division

<br>3x bottles of battle brew
<br>3x bottles of breserker brew, get a little health back or get health + attack
<br>3x bottles of potion / drink that we cannot recognize, two types of 3

<br>potion, used by soldiers, makes them less aware of their tiredness; roll to temp to ignore lvls of exhaustion; failed save gains more exhaustion


<br>Ring on goblin leader

<br>Purple gemstone
<br>
- ~~~Ring of message, allows message spell once per dawn you can choose to cast the spell telepathically as if you have used the subtle spell meta-magic; spell cast # of times per day as casting modifier~~~

<br>87 silver (60s actual), 312 copper (150c actual)
<br>2x bottles that look like minor healing potion, used by rory and hallbjorn

<br>Dragon: "Ah... Hello Daren. It's good to see you again... Old friend, it's been how many years since we've seen each other? Mortal years, maybe 78?"
<br>Daren?: "I have unfortunate news to pass onto you oh lord of the grove.... One of your old friends has died. King Lorei Dimbua has passed. You left after his regency ended. He wanted you at his funeral"
<br>Dragon shifts into a half-elven man (bright green eye, pale lavender eye). The dragon was there, under that new form (awe).
<br>Daren?: "They still call you many names there..."
<br>Dragon: "I wrote most of them myself! (snarky greenbelt ensues)... Did you come here to only inform me of a death?"
<br>....
<br>As the body draws the sword, they see the same symbol known in her sword. Unlike Rory's sword, it is undamaged and beautiful
<br>Awakens






<br>As we arrive at the inn, two trees come to greet us.

<br>None of us can read the book, but it feels evil...  It's not knowledge to be known

<br>It's a telling of events over time

Rory talks to our new friends about the sword

<br><a data-href="Rory" href="https://halkscout.github.io/Ethemore/(1)-the-party/rory.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Rory</a> shows them the sword
<br>Daren did not know who it belonged to, and they don't either
<br>It had a full handle, it was a little less broken but not by much
<br>They have not seen the sword in at least 300 years

<br>"That sword is older than I am..."


<br>Anyone who is versed in <a data-href="The Old Faith" href="https://halkscout.github.io/Ethemore/The Old Faith" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">The Old Faith</a> has heard of this person

<br>He is at least 5,000 years old
<br>An elderly figure who appears in time of need, someone who gave wisdom and guidance, etc. Has founded a dozen different houses...
<br>His wife very rarely referred to by name, but by <a data-href="Granny" href="https://halkscout.github.io/Ethemore/(2)-campaign/entities/gods/granny.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Granny</a>


<br>Rory asks many questions

<br>Daren had no children that they know of
<br>"You bear an <a data-href="Oathblade" href="https://halkscout.github.io/Ethemore/(2)-campaign/misc/oathblade.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Oathblade</a>, this magic has been old for time immoral. Much of it has faded. There were once perhaps 2-3 dozen similar blades, borne by different types of people. Some were heroic mythic figures, other sell swords... All of them held one truth, they were <a data-href="Oathsworn" href="https://halkscout.github.io/Ethemore/(2)-campaign/factions/oathsworn.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Oathsworn</a>.

<br><a data-href="Rory" href="https://halkscout.github.io/Ethemore/(1)-the-party/rory.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Rory</a> promised the woman on her deathbed that she would give it back to its owner


<br>"You are both the daughter of a knight and the daughter of a noble"

<br>A knight was told to protect his friends daughter... just in case they could not...


<br>"Your mother had many enemies... It's very hard to raise a child that people will exploit"
<br>She is alive, last the knew... Hasn't been seen in years, but last seen was a high-ranking advisor (3-4 years ago)

<br>Recently recovering from assassination attempts


<br>"That sword... even I can tell was recently broken further. When Daren wielded it, it never repaired itself for 30 years."

<br>Daren was last seen "wasting away" in a keep on <a data-href="Bay of Crabs" href="https://halkscout.github.io/Ethemore/(0)-obsidian_stuff/_uncategorized/bay-of-crabs.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Bay of Crabs</a> near the town of <a data-href="Antlers" href="https://halkscout.github.io/Ethemore/Antlers" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Antlers</a>

Shopping / Information Gathering

 <br>
<br>We loot the necromancer's lair, located past a trap door in the middle of the former battlefield 

<br>We find some books (comprehend languages)

<br>"The story of the beginning of the story" - creating life, humanoid
<br>"On thy rooi gloss" - A treatise written like an essay... "Red moon", lycanthropy relation to the 2nd moon
<br>Written in blood? "Hoffman's guide to big game hunting", how to hunt humans book

<br>We find a hidden room with a long dead dwarf and some money, some organs removed... waist has a belt with a dagger, has etchings of a coat of arms of "Gray Cloak"
<br>The dwarf has a crown on his forehead of small boned horns


<br>We see <a data-href="Greenbelt" href="https://halkscout.github.io/Ethemore/(2)-campaign/entities/greenbelt.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Greenbelt</a> and <a data-href="Richard" href="https://halkscout.github.io/Ethemore/(2)-campaign/entities/gods/richard.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Richard</a>, spend some time there.

Greenbelt turns into a person and has dinner with us and Richard.
<br>If you want to know more about Greenbelt's order, seek out the Endless or the Witch Queen... The rose quart might give info
<br>The arm thing is related to the lord of vicera, or perhaps a once elder spirit

<br>This fallen elder spirit had a desire to murder and kill, all that remains is nothing but red. She represents destruction and desecration of the infinite of the hands of the finite


<br>Rory has a vision in a <a data-href="Bloodwell Pit" href="https://halkscout.github.io/Ethemore/(2)-campaign/misc/old-faith/bloodwell-pit.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Bloodwell Pit</a>, where people are disputing over land...

<br>Boon:

<br>Uncommon (+1) item, while wearing and attuned, the divine fury does full damage. Action (1 every dawn) to gain 1 hit-die roll.






<br>We go back to everyone, the 3 reappearing.. Take some time to calm down then leave
<br>We travel and reach our destination of a tower with potential loot

<br>They lock us out of the tower, closing the door and engaging locks
<br>We knock again, they drop a rock on us and fire arrows through the windows
<br>Rory goes in :)

<br>Permanent Injury: <a data-href="Ghorza" href="https://halkscout.github.io/Ethemore/(1)-the-party/ghorza.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Ghorza</a> has lost her pinky and ring finger of her left hand. This has given her disadvantage on sleight of hand checks. These can only be restored via mid to high level restoration magic


<br><a data-href="Willa" href="https://halkscout.github.io/Ethemore/(1)-the-party/willa.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Willa</a> meets her goddess
<br>Ask question three and I will answer them to the best of my ability:

<br>What do you know about this, as much as possible?

<br>The wyrm who organized this is the father of that whelp you just fought. The <a data-href="Taker of Lives" href="https://halkscout.github.io/Ethemore/Taker of Lives" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Taker of Lives</a> is the title he has declared for himself. But... You fought his son. Unfortunately, that is not his only child... <a data-href="Mygath" href="https://halkscout.github.io/Ethemore/(2)-campaign/entities/ancients/mygath.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Mygath</a> is the only black dragon I have ever known to raise their young instead of throwing them out on their own. As such, his children are quite loyal to them. I know not how many who would fight, but 3 might cause trouble. One calls these swaps home, one swamps far to the south near the bay of crabs, one far far... far to the south deep in the lands of always winter.


<br>What do we need to defeat them?

<br>What you have already done as a party is the right trail to follow... Your items, growing in your own strength. I cannot give you power you cannot handle. This ask will take you years. I do not expect you to abandon others or aimless hunt them on your own. Do not fight them on their turf, split you all up, break you down one by one. They're [ambush predators], plan your own
<br>Slowly the stone climbs up her flesh, the goddess is becoming a statue again


<br>Do you know any weakness they have?

<br>These beings pollute and destroy. They cannot pollute that which cannot be polluted. Enchanted holy water, springs... If it can cure or cleanse it is antithetical to their being. Last hearing of <a data-href="Mygath" href="https://halkscout.github.io/Ethemore/(2)-campaign/entities/ancients/mygath.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Mygath</a> has been centuries, similar to <a data-href="Dracolichdom" href="https://halkscout.github.io/Ethemore/Dracolichdom" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Dracolichdom</a>... you might look into rumors. Burry the bodies here with honors, and burn those who infested my temple. Seal the library on the lower floors, let others know. Take what you need. It is all open to you and the fellows. This is now your mission, be damed what the temple says..... You honor me child, thank you, Lady <a data-href="Willa" href="https://halkscout.github.io/Ethemore/(1)-the-party/willa.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Willa</a>
<br>Creak of stone, vision fades as the statue comes back into its original place. Vision goes black, blinking back in, statue is broken once again covered in blood

<br>Why? Is she on our side? It benefits her to kill us here...


<br>Those conscious hear a horse thudding down the path. Finally, the battlefield calms. Her men pull away, they grab their dead and leave

<br>Bright silver hair pooling out from under helmet is the only defining feature she can see


<br>Her offering was left with intent, a question: Is she doing the right thing?

<br>This person sitting on a throne is a version of <a data-href="Myrmidia" href="https://halkscout.github.io/Ethemore/(2)-campaign/entities/gods/the-three-siblings/myrmidia.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Myrmidia</a> (The Red Knight?), she nods her head and <a data-href="Ghorza" href="https://halkscout.github.io/Ethemore/(1)-the-party/ghorza.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Ghorza</a> is filled with a sense of adrenaline of battle...

<br>Visions:

<br><a data-href="Blume" href="https://halkscout.github.io/Ethemore/(1)-the-party/blume.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Blume</a>

<br>Acid smells from the former fight are replaced with the smells of a forest, compost, rotten trees, growth, etc. Opening his eyes, he finds himself in a forest
<br>Following a deer path to a clearing on a hill. Sitting on it is the single largest tree <a data-href="Blume" href="https://halkscout.github.io/Ethemore/(1)-the-party/blume.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Blume</a> has ever seen
<br>Multitude of faces, each with different emotions

<br>"The chosen child seeks us out... Well, well... Lord Blume, brought before us to face the <a data-href="False Queen" href="https://halkscout.github.io/Ethemore/(2)-campaign/entities/false-queen.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">False Queen</a>. You have suffered much in your young age and will continue, your troubles are not over... But know this..."

<br>Every plant shivers and turns towards him, some growing more faces, all with open and shining eyes


<br>"Know that we chose you for a reason... Too many voices were silent and too many will continue to be silenced... There are very few who practice the old ways and fewer who will survive what is coming.. Fewer still who will listen when called..."

<br>Blume is called towards towards the tree, to a cave going under the tree
<br>Inside there is a throne made out of tree roots, many bigger than actual tree trunks
<br>The throne shrinks down to Blume size, he sits down in it and feels agony as his eye and leg is ripped off... The roots shiver and writhe as roots wrap around his leg and head..


<br>"You are the chosen, of we who simply are... We who are ever-vigilant, we the many faces of knowledge, of the eldest of the eldest, the endless, do you accept this title?" He does. The roots of the chair grow into his leg with searing agony as a tendril of roots grows out from his leg too... The roots are shaping into a branch that has grown out of his leg. It looks like a peg-leg. These roots also dig into his eye as he blinks away blood. He sees himself for a split second. He blinks again, his old eye eaten and his new eye is moving white threads. On the left half of his face is horns of tree roots growing out of his forehead. 

<br>Rise, <a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="Blume" data-href="Blume" href="https://halkscout.github.io/Ethemore/(1)-the-party/blume.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Lord Blume, of the Eldest of Eldest, Champion of the Endless, Agent of the Green Coven</a>
<br>Blinking again, he sees an emblem being stitched by the roots into his clothing

<br>An empty face, half smiling, half angry, a symbol of one of the <a data-href="Green Coven" href="https://halkscout.github.io/Ethemore/(2)-campaign/factions/green-coven.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Green Coven</a>

<br>As he dozes off, the smell of the bog and party talking fades. Opening his eyes again in an icy cave that has paintings and carvings of history that once was (peace, war, death, etc.). 
<br>In front of him is a small pathway he slowly makes his way down. At the end of this path is a large cavern, in the middle of it is a giant orc on a throne and sitting next to him is an absolutely massive green dragon curling around the throne. The orc is <a data-href="Agrius" href="https://halkscout.github.io/Ethemore/(2)-campaign/entities/gods/agrius.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Agrius</a>, the dragon <a data-href="Greenbelt" href="https://halkscout.github.io/Ethemore/(2)-campaign/entities/greenbelt.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Greenbelt</a>. <a data-href="Agrius" href="https://halkscout.github.io/Ethemore/(2)-campaign/entities/gods/agrius.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Agrius</a> and <a data-href="Greenbelt" href="https://halkscout.github.io/Ethemore/(2)-campaign/entities/greenbelt.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Greenbelt</a> are constantly shifting and transforming into different forms... <a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="Con'Niall" data-href="Con'Niall" href="https://halkscout.github.io/Ethemore/(1)-the-party/con'niall.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Niall</a> remembers tails of <a data-href="Greenbelt" href="https://halkscout.github.io/Ethemore/(2)-campaign/entities/greenbelt.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Greenbelt</a> and <a data-href="Agrius" href="https://halkscout.github.io/Ethemore/(2)-campaign/entities/gods/agrius.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Agrius</a>, some being thousands of years old, each tale representing a different form of what he sees.

<br><a data-href="Greenbelt" href="https://halkscout.github.io/Ethemore/(2)-campaign/entities/greenbelt.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Greenbelt</a> settles as a dragon with antlers and whiskers
<br>Around the room sits 3 empty thrones. He realizes this is the same cavern as his last vision


<br>Dialogue

<br><a data-href="Agrius" href="https://halkscout.github.io/Ethemore/(2)-campaign/entities/gods/agrius.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Agrius</a>: "You've done well...

"You have one task ahead of you.

This is what you traded for me saving your people. Your days of adventuring are numbered. You have one more task that you chose, and then you are mine until you die. And even then..."
<br><a data-href="Agrius" href="https://halkscout.github.io/Ethemore/(2)-campaign/entities/gods/agrius.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Agrius</a>: "As an agent of the <a data-href="Green Coven" href="https://halkscout.github.io/Ethemore/(2)-campaign/factions/green-coven.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Green Coven</a>, your task will be thus.

<br>Smells of acid from the last fight slowly fade as she falls asleep. They are replaced by the tang of iron, mud, and steel. She finds herself on the top of a grassy hill, surveying out she sees thousands and thousands of weapons-- many of which are bloody and bent. She is circled by a barrier of blades, placed around her like a fence post.

<br>She sees in front of her a roughly human woman in full plate mail, tear drop shaped shield, red cape and sash. Uncanny valley levels of near perfect looking except a terrifying large scar diagonally across her whole face. She is resting on her sword, staring out across the battle below.

<br>Curling up wrapped around sword, blinking before awakening to a familiar smell of sea spray.

Just a bay, sitting on a bench
<br>She sees a kind of ugly woman with bright red hair, relatively long hooked nose, green-ish skin (think witch), in one hand is a sword length item wrapped in cloth, in her other hand is her sharpened nails and a human heart with blood dripping down.

<br>Walking out of the bay is hundreds of half incorporeal figures walking out of the water.

There are hundreds, if not thousands, of these ghostly visages.
<br>The dock extends itself outwards, her now heaving their typical armor and weapons.

<br>A "green haired hag" shimmers as she approaches transforming into a beautiful woman, spinning a key with one bloodied hand while the other carries another item.

The situation in the capital is getting more dire as the <a data-href="False Queen" href="https://halkscout.github.io/Ethemore/(2)-campaign/entities/false-queen.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">False Queen</a> and her supporters gain more power."

The steel ripples, slowly turning a pink-ish red and rippled like water droplets in a pond. The blade seems a little longer and sturdier. The blade is now rounded at the tip and has a slight pink-red tint to the entire sword... Absorbing the ability of the magicians judge (dispel magic once per day). "I am the first of witches, the patron of the first witch, the first teacher of the old ways. We have taken much interest in your group. Use that as you will.

<br>Walking along randomly in a haze... Finding themself in a cave
<br>Images on the cave walls of what appears to be a werewolf form with large orcish tusks.

He follows a path deeper within
<br>Lounging in the center of a room is a lounging large wolf, shock white, red eyes, and tusks extending from the lower jaw (recognized as <a data-href="Agrius" href="https://halkscout.github.io/Ethemore/(2)-campaign/entities/gods/agrius.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Agrius</a>)
<br><a data-href="Agrius" href="https://halkscout.github.io/Ethemore/(2)-campaign/entities/gods/agrius.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Agrius</a> stands up, staring straight at <a data-href="Fyudor" href="https://halkscout.github.io/Ethemore/(1)-the-party/fyudor.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Fyudor</a>.

This wolf is not only large, but massive. A wolf larger than the dragon we fought
<br>Dialogue

<br><a data-href="Agrius" href="https://halkscout.github.io/Ethemore/(2)-campaign/entities/gods/agrius.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Agrius</a>: "You have come far in your journeys... and yet you do not seem to grasp this gift you have been given"

The gnawing feeling felt deep within gets worse as he says this, clawing to get out. After some reflection, instead of pain he feels cold. A clawed hand rips down out of his stomach as an ethereal form of himself crawls out of his body... It's <a data-href="Fyudor" href="https://halkscout.github.io/Ethemore/(1)-the-party/fyudor.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Fyudor</a>, but hazy with pure white empty eyes...

Losing control is but a part. To experience it is to learn it. Your fear gives it power. The last time I blessed someone with this gift was 15 years ago. I do not give this gift often. If you fail to live up to it again, I will take it from you. Consider this your only warning."
<br><a data-href="Agrius" href="https://halkscout.github.io/Ethemore/(2)-campaign/entities/gods/agrius.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Agrius</a>: "Now it is time to look within yourself, to look upon yourself and the wolf."

Frost ridden undead come out of the ground... And humanoids come out from the manor (some of which we recognize, have killed before, and have apparently been brought back): the healer bugbear, a large dwarf in full plate... <a data-href="Ser Danal" href="https://halkscout.github.io/Ethemore/(2)-campaign/people/ser-danal.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Ser Danal</a>...
